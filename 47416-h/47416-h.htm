<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>

<p class="in0">This book tells the story of Squadron No. 60 of
the Royal Flying Corps, afterwards of the Royal
Air Force.</p>

<p>When the war began, in August 1914, the Royal
Flying Corps was a very small body which sent
four squadrons on active service and had a
rudimentary training organisation at home. In
those days the only functions contemplated for
an airman were reconnaissance and occasionally
bombing. Fighting in the air was almost unknown.
The aeroplanes were just flying machines
of different types, but intended to perform
substantially the same functions. Gradually as
the war continued specialisation developed. Fighting
in the air began, machine guns being mounted
for the purpose in the aeroplanes. Then some
aeroplanes were designed particularly for reconnaissance,
some particularly for fighting, some for
bombing, and so on. It was in the early part of
this period of specialisation that Squadron No. 60
was embodied. And, as this narrative tells us,
its main work was fighting in the air. It was
equipped for the most part with aeroplanes which
were called scouts&mdash;not very felicitously, since a
scout suggests rather reconnaissance than combat.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">viii</a></span>
These machines carried only one man, were fast,
easy to manœuvre, and quick in responding to
control. They were armed with one or two
machine guns, and they engaged in a form of
warfare new in the history of the world, and the
most thrilling that can be imagined&mdash;for each man
fought with his own hand, trusting wholly to his
own skill, and that not on his own element, but in
outrage of nature, high in the air, surrounded only
by the winds and clouds.</p>

<p>The embodiment of the fighting scout squadrons
was part of the expansion and organisation of
what became the Royal Air Force. Among all
the achievements of the war there has been,
perhaps, nothing more wonderful than the development
of the Royal Flying Corps and the
Royal Naval Air Service, and their amalgamation
in the great Royal Air Force which fought through
the last year of the war. When the war opened,
the Royal Flying Corps and the Royal Naval Air
Service were bodies of few units, ancillary to the
Army and the Navy, of which the control was in
the hands of the Army Council and the Board of
Admiralty. It was not realised that warfare in
the air was a new and distinct type of warfare.
Generals who would have laughed at the idea of
commanding a fleet, Admirals who would have
shrunk from the leadership of an army corps,
were quite unconscious of their unfitness to deal
with the problems of aerial war. Every step,
therefore, of the organisation and expansion of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">ix</a></span>
the flying services had to be conducted under the
final control of bodies, kindly and sympathetic
indeed, but necessarily ignorant. That the Royal
Flying Corps attained to its famous efficiency and
was expanded more than a hundredfold should
earn unforgetting praise for those who were
responsible for leading and developing it. The
country owes a great debt, which has not, perhaps,
been sufficiently recognised, to Sir David Henderson,
whose rare gifts of quick intelligence and
ready resource must have been taxed to the
utmost in his dual position as head of the Flying
Corps and member of the Army Council; to Sir
Sefton Brancker, who worked under him in the
War Office; and to Sir Hugh Trenchard, who,
from the date that Sir David Henderson came
back from France to that of the amalgamation of
the flying services in the Royal Air Force, was in
command in France. It was the administrative
skill of these distinguished men that stood behind
the work of the squadrons and made possible their
fighting or bombing or reconnaissance. And this
background of administrative skill and resource
must not be forgotten or suffered to be quite
outshone by the brilliant gallantry of the pilots
and observers.</p>

<p>But in this book we read, not of the organisation
of the Flying Corps or the Air Force, but of the
actual work done in the field. We catch glimpses,
indeed, of the expansion and organisation which
was going on, in the mention of new armament,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">x</a></span>
new machines, new units; and we are able to
gauge the importance of the work done at home
and at Headquarters in France by the effect
produced on the fighting capacity of Squadron
No. 60. For example, we hear how machines
supplied from France at one point proved untrustworthy
in structure, and how the fault was
detected and put right. But in the main attention
is concentrated on the thrilling story of the
achievements of No. 60 against the enemy. I
think every reader will agree that he has seldom
known a story more moving to the imagination.
Many people even now feel apprehensive at flying
at all, although familiarity has produced a juster
estimate of the degree of risk attending that
operation than used to prevail. But to fly and
fight, to sit alone in an aeroplane thousands of
feet above the ground, to catch sight of an enemy,
to go to attack him, flying faster than an express
train moves, to venture as near as may be dared,
knowing that the slightest collision will cast both
helpless to the ground, to dodge and dive and turn
and spin, to hide in clouds or in the dazzle of the
sun, to fire a machine gun while not losing mastery
of the control and rudder of one’s aeroplane, to
notice the enemy’s bullets striking here and there
on one’s machine, and know that if a bullet hits
the engine it means either death or a precarious
landing and captivity, and if a bullet hits the
petrol tank it means being burned alive in the air,
and yet to fight on and, escaping, go forth afresh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">xi</a></span>
next day&mdash;surely to read of this is to realise with
new and penetrating force the stupendous measure
of what human skill can do and human courage
dare.</p>

<p>The picturesque effect of the fighting is enhanced
by the security and comfort in which the
pilots rested when they were not in the air, and
from which they went up day by day to their
terrific duties. Anyone who visited the Flying
Corps while the war was going on must have been
struck by this poignant contrast. The visitor
saw a comfortable mess and billets, roughly
organised indeed, but for young men in the height
of their strength a pleasant place to live in. Good
food and drink, cigarettes to smoke, newspapers
to read, and all the fun and merriment that are
natural to a group of young men between eighteen
and thirty years old. And for most of such
squadrons the surroundings seemed peaceful:
around were the smiling, highly-cultivated fields
of France&mdash;perhaps the most evidently civilised
country in the world&mdash;with nothing to witness of
war except the distant booming of its guns. Yet
from this abode of youth and ease and joy the
dwellers went forth into the abyss of the air, to
face danger at which imagination quails and of
the reality of which they were grimly reminded
by missing week by week some familiar face, gone
for ever from their circle. This was what was
done and felt by Squadron No. 60, and here is the
story of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">xii</a></span>
I am sure this book will interest those who read
it, but I would have it do something more. Even
already the memory of the war is beginning to
fade. And it is happy that it should: may its
orgy of hate and blood pass from our minds as
from our lives! Yet, while the healing, deadening
waters of oblivion are only drawing near, let
us save from them with careful hands some
jewelled memories, that by them we may be
profited; and, amongst them, this of the men of
No. 60, who fought a new warfare with old but
unsurpassed courage and found the way of glory
among the untrodden paths of air. Many died
and many suffered, but they bought for us the
unpriced treasure of their example. This is like
sunshine to us, giving us life and killing all
diseases of the soul. Let us, then, read these pages
that we may learn from our hearts to honour the
fighting airmen of No. 60, and grow ourselves in
honour as we read.</p>

<h2><a name="ACKNOWLEDGMENT" id="ACKNOWLEDGMENT"></a>AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT</h2>

<p class="in0">It has only been possible to produce this book at
all by reason of the help that so many old friends
have given me.</p>

<p>My thanks are due to many of them, but in
particular to Flight-Lieut. G. W. Dobson, who has
himself contributed the account of the squadron
at Savy, and has assisted with much of the more
arduous work in connection with the preparation
of the appendices, which we both hope are now
correct in every detail, though we really know
quite well that errors will, in fact, be found.</p>

<p>Capt. W. E. Molesworth also has helped very
greatly by allowing me to use his vivid letters and
by giving the four drawings by himself, which, I
venture to think, are of considerable merit. To
Mr. R. J. Maclennan, Mr. W. A. H. Newth, and
Mr. W. T. Howard, and also to Mr. G. S. Armstrong,
father of the late Capt. D. V. Armstrong,
perhaps the finest pilot the Flying Corps ever
produced, I owe letters and photographs which
have been invaluable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">xiv</a></span>
In conclusion, I would ask those many others
whom I have not space to mention to believe
that I am sincerely grateful for their help.</p>

<h2><a name="EXPLANATION" id="EXPLANATION">AN EXPLANATION OF TECHNICAL
TERMS USED</a></h2>

<p class="in0">The line drawing below of a typical tractor
biplane will explain to the non-technical reader
the meaning of many terms used hereafter which
are difficult to describe without the aid of a
diagram:</p>

<div id="ip_xix" class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
  <img src="images/i_xix.jpg" width="500" height="201" alt="Biplane parts" /></div>

<p>A monoplane has no lower planes, while the top
planes sprout from the side of the body like the
wings of a bird, but are rigid.</p>

<p>In either type of aeroplane it is the action of
the air on the wing surfaces, both upper and lower,
when the machine is travelling forward at a
minimum speed of about forty miles per hour
that keeps it in the air. If the speed is allowed
to drop below this minimum (known as the
flying speed) the machine “stalls,” i.e. becomes
uncontrollable, drops its nose and dives to regain
flying speed. If this happens near the ground&mdash;within<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">xx</a></span>
a hundred feet&mdash;a serious, and often
fatal, crash is the result.</p>

<p>Among the types of aeroplanes used in France
during 1916&ndash;18, and mentioned in these pages but
not described in detail, are:</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">B.E.2C., R.E.8, and Other Types of
Two-seater Machines</span></h3>

<p>All two-seater machines carrying one pilot and
one observer which were chiefly used for artillery
observation, i.e. correcting, by observation from
the air, the fire of batteries on the ground.</p>

<p>These were tractor biplanes, i.e. the engine and
propeller were in front, while the observer and
pilot sat tandem in two cockpits, or nacelles, in
the fish-shaped body.</p>

<h3>F.E.2B.</h3>

<p>A two-seater fighting biplane of the “pusher”
type with the engine behind the pilot, who with
the observer sat in a cockpit which protruded
beyond the leading, or forward, edges of the
planes. This aeroplane was used for day and
night bombing, for fighting in 1916 and the first
half of 1917, and also for reconnaissance and
photographic work.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">De Havilland 4</span></h3>

<p>A high-speed tractor two-seater biplane used
for bombing, reconnaissance work, and photography.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Nieuport, S.E.5, and Sopwith Camel</span></h3>

<p>Single-seater fighting scouts, all tractor biplanes.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE FORMATION OF THE SQUADRON</span></h2>

<p class="in0">To create a new flying unit is a task which entails
much thought and labour, and the formation of
60 had been a matter for the careful consideration
of the R.F.C. authorities for many months
before the squadron number could appear on
any of those manifold returns, without a bountiful
supply of which no country seems able to go to
war. Vital points for preliminary consideration
are: The type of aeroplane and the numbers of
this type likely to be available in the future; the
engines, and, no less important, the spares which
must be procured in adequate quantities if these
engines are to be kept in running condition. The
training units, too, must be increased in order to
keep the new service formation up to strength in
pilots. A sufficient number of trained mechanics
must be got from somewhere, and these have
usually to be wrung from the commanders of other
units, themselves already short of trained personnel,
and as a rule most reluctant to part with
good men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
All these matters were at last decided, and
60 Squadron was formed on May 1, 1916. At
that time there were in the Royal Flying Corps
about thirty-five service squadrons all told, of
which by far the greater number were in France.
The Royal Naval Air Service had at this date
considerably fewer service units. When the
Armistice was signed, there were well over two
hundred service squadrons in the Royal Air Force,
which had come into being as an independent
entity distinct from the Army or the Navy on
April 1, 1918. During the months previous to the
formation of 60, the Germans, with the aid of
the Fokker monoplane, which they produced in
the autumn of 1915, had begun seriously to interfere
with our artillery observation machines. At
this period of the war&mdash;early 1916&mdash;we had no
complete single-seater fighting scout squadrons,
but achieved the protection of the artillery
machines, mostly B.E.2C.s, by having a few
Bristol and other scouts in each two-seater
squadron.</p>

<p>As a result of these losses, General Trenchard
decided to form some new scout squadrons, of
which 60 shortly became one, and also to re-equip
some of the existing squadrons with scouts. No. 1
Squadron, for example, was given Nieuports (a
French machine), at that time the equal of any
German fighter.</p>

<p>No. 60 was formed from No. 1 Reserve Aeroplane
Squadron at Gosport. Major F. Waldron,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
known to his friends as “Ferdy,” was the first
commander of the new unit. He had previously
commanded No. 1 R.A.S., and was a cavalry officer
who had been seconded from his Hussar regiment
(the 19th), some time before the war, to the R.F.C.
He was one of the earlier military aviators. He
had been an instructor at the Central Flying
School at Upavon and was a first-class pilot.
The three original flight commanders (Capts. R.
Smith-Barry, A. S. M. Somers, and H. C. Tower)
were all three old Etonians. The original flying
officers were: Capt. D. B. Gray; Lieuts. H. A.
Browning-Paterson, J. N. Simpson, G. F. A.
Portal, H. H. Balfour, H. Meintjies, A. D. Bell-Irving;
2/Lieuts. C. A. Ridley, D. V. Armstrong,
H. G. Smart, and G. D. F. Keddie.</p>

<p>The observers were: Lieuts. R. H. Knowles
and G. Williams; 2/Lieuts. L. L. Clark, H. J.
Newton, H. H. Harris, H. Good, C. F. Overy,
J. I. M. O’Beirne, W. E. G. Bryant, J. Laurie-Reid,
J. N. O. Heenan (A.E.O.), and J. Bigood
(A.E.O., wireless).</p>

<p>Usually a new squadron received its machines
in England at its home station and flew them over
to France. 60 Squadron, however, was to be
equipped with Moranes, French machines which
were not built in England at that time. Consequently
the squadron, with its motor transport,
stores, etc., crossed to France by sea, and went
to St. Omer, where its equipment was completed.</p>

<p>An R.F.C. squadron had two sergeant-majors:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
one disciplinary, the other technical. Waldron,
when forming 60, chose these warrant officers with
considerable discretion. Sergt.-Maj. Aspinall, an
old Guardsman brought into the Flying Corps by
Basil Barrington-Kennet in the very early days,
was the disciplinary warrant officer. He had
qualified as a rigger and had tried to learn to fly,
but it was as a disciplinarian that he really shone.
He played no inconsiderable part in the achievement
of whatever success the squadron may have
had. He was a first-class soldier, and his instructions
to flight commanders in the form of little
typewritten lectures were gems of their kind. It
should be remembered that at times the casualties
in the squadron were very heavy, and officers
became flight commanders at an age which would
have been regarded as absurd before the war.
“The Great Man,” as we called him, would explain
with profound respect to a captain promoted,
most deservedly, at the age of nineteen the
necessity for assuming a judicial demeanour when
an air mechanic was brought up before him on
some minor charge; he would, further, instruct
the young flight commander most carefully in the
punishments appropriate to each offence, and all
this without in the smallest particular transgressing
that code of military etiquette which regulates
so strictly the relations between commissioned and
warrant officers. Only his successive commanding
officers know how much of the tranquillity and
contentment of the men was due to “the Great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
Man.” The technical sergeant-major, Smyrk by
name, was a wizard with an internal combustion
engine. He had been employed at the Gramophone
Co.’s factory at Hayes in civil life before
joining the R.F.C. in 1912, and had a gift for
teaching fitters their business. During almost all
the war, two fitters a month had to be sent home
to assist in the manning of new units, while the
squadrons in the field had, in consequence, always
to carry a percentage of untrained or partially
trained men, who had to be made into experts on
the engines with which they were equipped. The
technical sergeant-major had to train these men,
and was also the specialist who was called in
whenever one of the flights had an unusually
refractory engine which had baffled both the flight
commander and his flight sergeant. Smyrk was
always equal to every call upon him, and a long
line of pilots should, and no doubt do, remember
him with gratitude, for, after all, the degree of
efficiency with which the engine was looked after
often meant the difference between a landing in
Hunland and getting home.</p>

<p>After a few days at St. Omer we received our
machines, which were Moranes of three different
types: “A” Flight had Morane “bullets,”
80 h.p.; “B” Flight, 110 h.p. Morane biplanes;
and “C” Flight, Morane “parasols.”</p>

<p>Of the “parasol,” a two-seater monoplane, it is
unnecessary to say very much, as they were soon
replaced by “bullets,” and “C” Flight did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
practically no work on them. The machine is
best, perhaps, described as a biplane without any
bottom planes, by which is meant that the wings
were above the pilot’s head, a feature which
suggested its nickname. It had an 80 h.p. Le
Rhone at that time, almost the best air-cooled
rotary engine. They were good for artillery
registration, as the view downward was excellent;
they were very stable also, easy to fly and to land,
and, in fact, were “kind” machines, giving their
pilots the sort of feeling afforded by a good-tempered,
confidential old hunter.</p>

<p>The Morane biplane had a more powerful engine,
the 110 Le Rhone, also an air-cooled rotary, and
was quite an efficient “kite,” as the R.F.C. called
them, with its inveterate habit of inventing pet
names for its aeroplanes. It was draughty and
cold to sit in, but was light on the controls and had
a reasonably good performance. This machine
was also a two-seater, like the “parasol,” with
the observer’s seat behind the pilot’s.</p>

  <div class="caption">PATROL OF MORANE “BULLETS” ABOUT TO LEAVE THE GROUND, VERT GALANT, JUNE 1916.</div></div>

<p>The Morane “bullet,” with a 80 h.p. Le Rhone
engine, was quite a different proposition.</p>

<p>This was a monoplane with a fuselage (body) of
the monococque, or cigar-shaped, type and very
small wings, giving, therefore, a very high loading
per square foot of lifting surface. The speed near
the ground was not too bad for 1916, being about
ninety to ninety-five miles per hour, but, owing
to the high loading on the wings, the machine
became inefficient at a height. It had the gliding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
angle of a brick, as a pilot moodily complained
after an unsuccessful forced landing. It
is obvious that, if a machine has a very small
wing surface, it must be kept going fast, when
gliding without the engine, to preserve its flying
speed, and this can only be done by keeping the
nose well down; hence the unfriendly description
quoted above.</p>

<p>Above 10,000 feet it was difficult to turn a
“bullet” sharply and steeply without “stalling”;
moreover, in bad weather it was very uncomfortable
to fly, giving the impression that it was trying
its best to kill the pilot all the time. The lateral
<span class="locked">control,<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></span> of the “warp” type, was to some extent
responsible for this. The armament was a fixed
Lewis gun firing through the propeller, which was
fitted with a metal deflector&mdash;a steel wedge which
prevented the propeller being shot through. There
was no synchronising gear on any of the Moranes.
By this is meant the device by which the detonation
of the gun was harmonised with the beat of
the propeller; actually the gun is blocked when
the blades of the propeller are in the line of fire.</p>

<p>Later on we were given some “bullets” with
110 h.p. Le Rhones, but these were no better, as
the loading was even higher with the heavier
engine, and their performance above 8,000 feet was
consequently poor. The climb for the first few
thousand feet was wonderful, as the engine seemed
almost to pull the machine straight up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
Generally speaking, the “bullet” was not a
success, as it was too difficult to fly for the average
pilot. Nevertheless, as several of our pilots,
notably Smith-Barry, Gilchrist, Foot, Grenfell,
Meintjies, and Hill, and in particular D. V. Armstrong,
were considerably above the average, some
useful work was accomplished on these machines.</p>

<p>The equipment having been completed, we
moved to Boisdinghem, between St. Omer and
Boulogne, for a few days’ practice with the new
machines. This was very necessary, as hardly
anyone had flown Moranes before.</p>

<p>On June 10 we were ordered to Vert Galant, an
aerodrome astride the Doullens-Amiens road, and
joined the 13th Wing of the 3rd Brigade R.F.C.,
operating with the 3rd Army. War flying was
started a few days later, and it at once became
apparent that our anti-aircraft batteries found
difficulty in distinguishing our “bullets” from the
Fokkers. In consequence the black cowls of our
machines were painted red to help the <span class="locked">“archie”<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></span>
gunners, who had been assiduously firing at 60’s
machines.</p>

  <div class="caption">CLAUDE A. RIDLEY, D.S.O., M.C., IN A MORANE “BULLET.”</div></div>

<p>The work at this time chiefly consisted of
offensive patrols, which were supposed to keep
the air clear for our corps and bombing machines.
Numerous reconnaissances were also carried out.
In these days scouts usually worked in pairs,
but larger formations of five and six machines
were becoming more common; later in the war<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
it was the rule to send out a whole squadron,
or as many of its machines as were serviceable,
over the line at once; but in 1916 aeroplanes
and pilots were, usually, too scarce to send more
than two off the ground at once.</p>

<p>On August 3, 1916, Claude Ridley had a forced
landing near Douai through engine failure when
dropping a spy over the lines. His adventures
were remarkable. His spy got out, told Ridley
to hide for a little, and presently, returning with
civilian clothes and some money, told him that he
must now shift for himself. Ridley did so with
such address that he eluded capture for three
months on the German side of the line, and
eventually worked his way via Brussels to the
Dutch frontier and escaped. This was a good
performance, none the worse because he could
speak neither French nor German. The method
he adopted was a simple one&mdash;he would go up to
some likely-looking civilian and say, “I am a
British officer trying to escape; will you help me?”
They always did. He had many interesting
adventures. For example, he lay up near the
Douai aerodrome and watched the young Huns
learning to fly and crashing on the aerodrome;
here he saw one of our B.E.s brought down, and
the pilot and observer marched past him into
captivity; later the conductor of a tram in the
environs of Brussels suspected him, but, knocking
the man down, he jumped into a field of standing
corn and contrived to elude pursuit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
This method of landing spies was not popular
with R.F.C. pilots, as there was always quite a
chance that one might not be able to get the
machine off again, and, anyhow, it was a nerve-racking
experience to have to land in a field after a
necessarily hurried survey from the air, and wait
while your spy climbed slowly&mdash;very slowly&mdash;out.
Later, different and, from the pilot’s point of
view, improved devices were adopted; the spy
was made to sit on the plane with a parachute and
to jump off when told. Occasionally they refused
to jump, nor is it easy to blame them, so a further
improvement is said to have been introduced by
which the pilot could pull a lever and drop the
wretched agent out through the bottom of the
fuselage, after which he parachuted down to earth.</p>

<p>They were very brave men, these French spies
who voluntarily entered the occupied territory
in this hazardous manner. They were usually
dropped either in the late evening or early
morning.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE SOMME</span></h2>

<p class="in0">Sixty had not to wait long for its first taste of
serious fighting. The “aerial offensive,” which
always precedes any “push,” was already well
developed when the squadron commenced war
flying. Casualties were heavy, and on July 3,
two days after the official commencement of the
Somme battle, Ferdy Waldron was shot down and
killed on the “other side.” He considered it his
duty to try and do one job per day over the line,
and on this particular morning he led “A” Flight’s
80 h.p. “bullets” over at 4 a.m. in perfect weather.
The other members of the patrol were Smith-Barry,
Armstrong, Simpson, and Balfour. The
last-named thus describes the fight: “Both
Armstrong and Simpson fell out, through engine
trouble, before we reached Arras. Armstrong
landed by a kite balloon section and breakfasted
with Radford (Basil Hallam, the actor), whose
kite balloon was attacked a few days later, and
who met his death through the failure of his
parachute. Waldron led the remaining two along
the Arras-Cambrai road. We crossed at about
8,000 feet, and just before reaching Cambrai we
were about 9,000, when I suddenly saw a large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
formation of machines about our height coming
from the sun towards us. There must have been
at least twelve. They were two-seaters led by
one Fokker (monoplane) and followed by two
others. I am sure they were not contemplating
‘war’ at all, but Ferdy pointed us towards them
and led us straight in.</p>

<p>“My next impressions were rather mixed. I
seemed to be surrounded by Huns in two-seaters.
I remember diving on one, pulling out of the dive,
and then swerving as another came for me. I can
recollect also looking down and seeing a Morane
about 800 feet below me going down in a slow
spiral, with a Fokker hovering above it following
every turn. I dived on the Fokker, who swallowed
the bait and came after me, but unsuccessfully,
as I had taken care to pull out of my dive while
still above him. The Morane I watched gliding
down under control, doing perfect turns, to about
2,000 feet, when I lost sight of it. I thought he
must have been hit in the engine. After an
indecisive combat with the Fokker I turned home,
the two-seaters having disappeared. Smith-Barry
I never saw from start to finish of the
fight. I landed at Vert Galant and reported that
Ferdy had ‘gone down under control.’ We all
thought he was a prisoner, but heard soon afterwards
that he had landed safely but died of
wounds that night, having been hit during the
scrap.</p>

<p>“About twenty minutes after I had landed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
Smith-Barry came back. He had not seen us, but
had been fighting the back two Fokkers, which he
drove east, but not before he had been shot about
by them, one bullet entering the tail and passing
up the fuselage straight for his back until it hit
the last cross-member, which deflected the course
of the missile sufficiently to save him.”</p>

<p>This was the end of a first-class squadron
commander, and, coming so early in our fighting
career, was a heavy blow. If he had lived,
Waldron must have made a great name for himself
in the R.F.C.</p>

<p>Smith-Barry now took over the squadron. He
was a great “character”&mdash;an Irishman with all
an Irishman’s charm. A trifle eccentric, he was
a fine pilot. He had crashed badly near Amiens
in the retreat from Mons, the first Flying Corps
casualty, breaking both his legs, which left him
permanently lame. Although beloved by his
squadron, his superiors sometimes found him a
little trying officially. It is often said, half
admiringly, of a man by his friends that “he
doesn’t care a damn for anyone.” I believe this to
have been almost literally true of Smith-Barry. He
could do anything with an aeroplane, and delighted
in frightening his friends with incredible aerial
antics. He was a fine, if original, squadron
commander, almost too original, in fact, even for
the R.F.C., where, if anywhere in the fighting
services, originality was encouraged. At a later
stage (in 1917) in Smith-Barry’s career he rendered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
a very great service to the Corps and to the
country by bringing his contempt for precedent
and genius for instruction to bear on the question
of teaching pilots to fly. It is no exaggeration to
say that he revolutionised instruction in aviation,
and, having been given almost a free hand by
General J. Salmond, he organised his Gosport
School of Special Flying, which afterwards developed
into a station where all flying instructors
were trained.</p>

<p>He has been seen to walk down the Strand in
full uniform with an umbrella.</p>

<p>When promoted in 1918 to the command of a
brigade, he, having come into conflict with
authority, dispatched the following telegrams on
the same day to his immediate superior: (1) “Am
returning to Gosport. Smith-Barry, Brig.-Gen.”
(2) “Have arrived at Gosport. Smith-Barry,
Lieut.-Col.”</p>

<p>Smith-Barry’s batman was a French boy named
Doby, a refugee from Lille, whom Nicolson,
sometime private secretary to General Seely and
one of the early pilots of the R.F.C., had picked
up during the retreat from Mons and taken back
to England with him. When Nicolson was
killed at Gosport, Smith-Barry appointed Doby
as his batman and, in order to take him to France,
dressed him in R.F.C. uniform and called him Air
Mechanic Doby. This boy was most useful, being
competent to bargain with his compatriots for the
goods which the mess required. When a year had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
gone by and there had been several changes in
command, nobody knew his history, and he was
regarded as a genuine member of the Corps.
History does not relate how he was eventually
“demobilised.”</p>

<p>This, then, was the kind of man who took over
the squadron on Waldron’s death&mdash;at a critical
point in its career.</p>

<p>Those who were most conspicuous during the
battles of the Somme were: Ball (who joined from
11 Squadron in August), Summers and Tower (two
of the original flight commanders), Gilchrist, Latta,
Grenfell, Meintjies, A. D. Bell Irving, Phillippi,
Hill, Foot, Vincent, Armstrong, and Walters.
Foot, as one of the most skilful pilots, was given
a “Spad,” on which he did great execution
during the autumn.</p>

<p>The fighting was mainly over places like
Bapaume, Courcelette, Martinpuich, Busigny,
St. Quentin, Cambrai, Havrincourt, etc.</p>

<p>Ball began to show very prominently about
this time, several times destroying two or more
hostile aeroplanes, and hardly a day passed
without at least one Hun being added to his
bag. Much has been written about Albert Ball,
so much that at this date it is difficult to add
anything of interest to the accounts which are
already so widely known; but this at least can
confidently be said, that never during the war has
any single officer made a more striking contribution
to the art of war in the air than he, who was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
the first to make what may be called a business of
killing Huns. He allowed nothing to interfere
with what he conceived to be the reason of his
presence in an aeroplane in France&mdash;the destruction
of the enemy wherever and whenever he
could be found. He was a man&mdash;a boy in truth&mdash;of
a kindly nature, possessed by a high sense of
duty and patriotism. These months (August and
September 1916) saw Ball at his best, and though
it is true that he was awarded the Victoria Cross
after his death in an heroic fight in the spring of
1917, when he was a flight commander in 56
Squadron, yet it was in the summer and autumn
of 1916 in 11 and 60 Squadrons that he began to
show the Flying Corps what fighting in the air
really meant. The copy of a report rendered to
R.F.C. H.Q. is given below:</p>

<p>Of the others, Latta became a wonderful pilot;
Gilchrist, a gallant South African, commanded 56
at the end of the war and became one of the very
best instructors under Smith-Barry at Gosport;
Roderick Hill, a fine pilot, is also an artist of no
small reputation; A. D. Bell Irving worthily
upheld the traditions of an heroic Canadian family
whose name will always appear prominently in
any history of the Air Force; while Meintjies,
also a South African, though young, himself displayed
an infinite patience, together with a
wisdom far beyond his years, in the introduction
of new pilots to the hazardous game of aerial
fighting as practised on the Western Front, of
which he himself was a first-class exponent.</p>

<p>As for D. V. Armstrong, a South African, who
was killed in a crash just as the war had ended,
and who after leaving 60 became a brilliant night-flying
pilot, the following letter from Col. Small
will give some slight idea of the work done by him
in 151 Night Fighting Squadron.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“At 10.40 on the night of September 17/18,
whilst on patrol east of Bapaume, Capt. Armstrong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
observed a Gotha biplane caught in a
concentration of searchlight at 8,500 feet, with a
Camel machine behind it.</p>

<p>“Seeing the Camel was not engaging the E.A.
(enemy aeroplane) from a sufficiently close range,
this officer dived down, coming in on the E.A.’s
right. He closed right up under its tail and fired
100 rounds into it. The E.A. then burst into
flames and dived to the ground, where it burst
into pieces just east of Bapaume.</p>

<p>“On the night of September 10/11, 1918, on
receipt of a report that E.A. was over the 4th
Army front, Capt. Armstrong volunteered to go
up, although the weather was practically impossible
for flying, the wind blowing at about fifty
miles an hour, accompanied by driving rain storms.
In spite of this, Capt. Armstrong remained on his
patrol 1 hour 5 minutes, although his machine
was practically out of control on several occasions.
On landing, his machine had to be held down to
prevent it being blown over.</p>

<p>“On the night of August 6/7, 1918, Capt.
Armstrong attacked Estrées-en-Chaussée aerodrome.
After dropping three Cooper bombs on
the hangars from 600 feet, he observed an E.A.
coming in to land. Capt. Armstrong then closed
under the E.A.’s tail and opened fire from fifteen
yards’ range when at 700 feet. The E.A.’s
observer answered the fire, and then suddenly
ceased altogether. Capt. Armstrong continued
firing until the E.A. suddenly turned to the right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
with nose down and crashed on its aerodrome,
bursting into flames as it struck the ground. This
officer then dropped his fourth bomb on the wreck
and fired a further burst into it, returning to his
aerodrome with all ammunition expended.</p>

<p>“On the night of August 8/9, 1918, although
the clouds were at about 500 feet, this officer flew
to the same hostile aerodrome, but finding no
activity there and seeing no lights whatever, he
flew to Cizancourt Bridge, dropping his four bombs
upon it from 500 feet.</p>

<p>“On this night he was unable at any period
to fly at over 800 feet, owing to low driving clouds
and a very strong wind.</p>

<p>“Capt. Armstrong attacked aerodromes as
follows on the dates shown:</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Moislans</span>, 3.15 a.m. to 3.30 a.m. on August
21/22, 1918, dropping two incendiary and two
Cooper bombs from 400 feet on hutments and
tents, although subjected to the most accurate
and fierce machine-gun fire from the ground and
his machine being brightly illuminated in the
glare of the incendiary bombs.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Estrées-en-Chaussée</span>, on the night of July
31&mdash;August 1, 1918, dropping four bombs on
landing lights from 500 feet.</p>

<p>“Capt. Armstrong took part in the defence of
London against all but three raids by E.A.
between September 1917 and June 1918.</p>

<p>“This officer has been the right hand of his
squadron commander since the formation of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
squadron, and has, by his wonderful flying, taught
the pilots of 151 Squadron more than any other
instructor could possibly have done. He has
demonstrated to all pilots daily the only successful
method of attack at night against E.A. by
personal supervision of their flying.</p>

<p>“As a flight commander I cannot speak too
highly of him and his wonderful spirit at all times.
His bravery as a pilot at all times and in all
weather conditions cannot be surpassed, and I am
unable to recommend him too strongly for this
decoration.</p>

<p>It was about this time that “balloon strafing”
was invented by Headquarters. Three Le Prieur
rockets of the ordinary type were attached to the
interplane struts on each wing; these were fired
by means of an electric bell-push in the nacelle (or
pilot’s seat), and if they hit the hostile kite balloon,
were guaranteed to send it down in flames. The
effect of this extra load was to make the machine
singularly unhandy when fighting, but it must be
admitted that they did effectually set hostile kite
balloons alight if the pilot was sufficiently resolute
to restrain himself from pressing the button until
he was within 150 yards of the object balloon.
This sounds much easier than, in fact, it was, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
hostile balloons were usually found as low as
2,500 feet, and the wretched pilot had to contend
with heavy gunfire from the ground, while always
remembering that he was some considerable distance
over the line and had sacrificed his height in
order to approach the balloon. The aeroplane of
those days would glide about one mile per 1,000
feet in still air, and, remembering that the balloons
were usually at least two miles behind the line
and that the wind was almost always from the
west, it will be obvious that, if the engine was hit,
there was very little chance of gliding back over
the trenches. Hence it will be readily understood
that balloon strafing was not enormously popular
among junior flying officers.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Gilchrist, Bell Irving, Summers,
Phillippi, and Hill all successfully brought down
hostile kite balloons during the Somme battles
(September 1916).</p>

<p>Later, in 1917, Buckingham incendiary ammunition
was used for destroying balloons. This
change was greatly appreciated by the R.F.C.,
because the handiness of the machine was not
impaired, as was the case when the Le Prieur
rockets were carried.</p>

<p>From Vert Galant the squadron moved to St.
André on August 3, 1916, to refit, having only five
pilots left. There the first flight of Nieuport scouts
was received and, after a fortnight, another move
was ordered to Izel le Hameau on August 16.
This was an aerodrome we were destined to occupy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
again during the Arras battle. We here became
a homogeneous unit completely equipped with
Nieuport scouts, and moved three miles away to
Savy, midway between Arras and St. Pol, early in
September. Here, during November, little flying
was possible owing to continual rain and fog, and
the squadron settled down, almost in the Roman
manner, into winter-quarters. Savy Aerodrome
stood just above the village of that name, and
while “C” Flight were accommodated in huts on
the aerodrome so as to be near their machines in
order to deal quickly with any Huns who were
bold enough to cross the line, the remainder of the
squadron were billeted in the Mayor’s château in
the village itself, some half a mile away. Here
pigs and turkeys were kept, out of which the mess
made a good profit, and which, in addition, provided
both an excellent Christmas dinner for the
men and the material for the farewell banquet to
Smith-Barry, who was posted to Home Establishment
early in December. This dinner was somewhat
memorable. The guests included General
Higgins (the brigade commander), Pretyman (the
wing commander), Col. Lewis and Barnaby of the
“archie” gunners, Robert Loraine and several
other squadron commanders. The squadron
band, organised by Vincent, performed during
dinner with great vigour. Led by Sergt. Nicod
at the piano and conducted by Vincent himself, it
helped to enliven the evening very considerably.</p>

<p>In addition to the band, the squadron ran at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
this period both a Rugby and an Association
football team. The Rugby side was for a time
invincible, the leading players being Middlemas,
the wing machine-gun officer, an old Cambridge
Blue and a fine three-quarter; D. Bell Irving and
Giles, a first-class pair of halves; and Meintjies,
a tower of strength at full back. The Soccer
team also won many matches, captained by the
“Great Man,” Sergt.-Maj. Aspinall; while the
stores sergeant, a league player, was the star
performer at centre-forward. Matches were very
difficult to arrange, as they had to be postponed
if the weather was fine, and could only take place,
therefore, on thoroughly “dud” days, to use the
inevitable R.F.C. expression.</p>

<p>Smith-Barry was succeeded by Major E. P.
Graves, a regular gunner, young in years, who had
crashed a Gnome Martinsyde scout at Netheravon
early in 1915 and spent many months in hospital,
emerging towards the end of that year permanently
lame but quite fit to fly. He had been staff
captain and brigade major to General Higgins at
home when recovering from his injuries, but as
soon as he became fit gave his General no peace
until he was allowed to go to France in a fighting
unit. He got posted to 20 Squadron as a flight
commander early in 1916, and had been sent home
again on promotion to command a training
squadron after six months of very good work in
France. Soon after he had taken over, the
squadron was moved from Savy back to Izel le<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
Hameau, the correct name of the station being
Filescamp Farm. Here, with the aid of the local
R.E. and thanks to Graves’s tireless efforts, an
almost ideal little station was created in the
orchard adjoining the great grey walls of M.
Tetus’s demesne. This was a very old and
picturesque house, half farm and half château,
and was removed some two miles from a main
road or railway line, a circumstance which prevented
the aerodrome being bombed at night for
a very long time, as it was hard to see from the air.
An admirable mess, with a large brick fireplace,
corrugated-iron hangars, together with Nissen
huts for the officers and N.C.O.s and good accommodation
for the men, were all built by the sappers.
At this station in M. Tetus’s orchard the squadron
found a quiet retreat when not actually engaged
with the enemy. It is, perhaps, appropriate here
to observe that every pilot at this time did, on the
average, three patrols in two days over the line,
and seldom returned to the aerodrome without a
brush of some kind with the Boche. The contrast
between our quarters and those occupied by the
infantry and gunners in the line was striking. We
had cream at every meal, and a hot bath&mdash;made
by digging an oblong hole in the turf and lining it
with a waterproof sheet&mdash;whenever we felt inclined.
That the mess was good was largely due
to Dobson, a 19th Hussar, partly paralysed as
the result of a fall when riding in a steeplechase
before the war, who was the recording officer at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
this time, having vainly tried to qualify as an
observer in spite of his disability.</p>

<p>During the early months of 1917 there was a
very hard frost, which made it difficult for the
Germans to start their engines, most of which
were water-cooled stationaries, but did not affect
60’s air-cooled rotaries, though both sides found
that their machine guns were almost useless owing
to the extreme cold. This frost lasted till mid-February.</p>

<p>Below will be found the first of a series of
letters written by Molesworth, who joined the
squadron at this time. They have been inserted
as far as possible whenever the narrative reaches
the events which they describe.</p>

<p>“It has been snowing hard all day, so at last I
have a chance of sending you a scrawl.</p>

<p>“Well! old bean, I had my first trip with my
flight commander over the lines on the 2nd. My
word! it was some trip too, I can tell you. I
was posted to ‘A’ Flight and allotted a machine.
Having interviewed my C.O. with much fear and
trembling, I was told that he would take me up to
the lines to have a look round. My job was to
watch and follow my leader, look out for any
Huns and get a good idea of the ground. By
this time I had got well acquainted with my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
machine, or <span class="locked">‘grid,’<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a></span> as it was generally called by
one of our Colonial flight commanders, and felt
quite confident that, if we met any Huns, I could
give them a pretty hot time.</p>

<p>“We started off late in the afternoon, climbing
to about 8,000 feet. The view was wonderful&mdash;the
ground covered with a thin coating of snow,
while far away one could see the incessant flashing
of the guns near the battered old town of Arras.
White clouds floated in the ground mist over the
eastern horizon like great icebergs, their tops
tinged with a wonderful pink which one only sees
in the air.</p>

<p>“I shall never forget that first impression of
the battle-field from an aeroplane; it was so
different to the sights of war on the ground. No
Huns were on view, but a few of our artillery
machines were still working. We turned home
and landed in the dusk.</p>

<p>“I don’t think I told you about a Boche we
brought down last week. We got him quite near
the aerodrome&mdash;apparently he had lost his way
in the clouds. He appeared out of them at about
3,000 feet over our heads. Of course, every
available machine dashed off in pursuit, and
caught him up in a few minutes, as he was forced
to turn from the lines by some old F.E. <span class="locked">Birds.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
They all went for him, and he had to land in a
ploughed field near-by. He put the machine
down quite well, without crashing anything, but
one of his pursuers, who belonged to the squadron
next to us, turned upside down in his excitement
when landing. However, he did not hurt himself,
and managed to prevent the Hun from setting
his machine on fire, by holding a Very <span class="locked">pistol<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a></span> at
his head.</p>

<p>“Afterwards I had a chat with the prisoner in
French, and found out that he was a star pilot,
having a number of our machines to his credit and
the inevitable Iron Cross.</p>

<p>“I am all out for getting a Hun now, and hope
to be able to tell you, when I next write, that my
name has appeared in <i>Comic Cuts</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The Nieuport scout deserves a short description,
as it was on the successive types of this aeroplane
that nearly a year’s work was done, from September
1916 to July 1917. This single-seater fighter
was a French machine, and one of the most
successful in its day which our allies ever produced.
The various types of this make with which the
squadron was at different times equipped&mdash;15, 16,
17, 21, 24, and 29&mdash;showed a continuous improvement
in performance, though all had the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
engine, 110 h.p. Le Rhone, which itself was
modified slightly and converted into a 120 h.p.
engine by the substitution of aluminium for cast-iron
pistons. Through all the modifications introduced
in each successive type the machine preserved
its essential characteristics. It was a
biplane, but its lower planes were non-lifting and
only operated to stabilise the machine to some
extent in flight; the top planes were streamlined
with the pilot’s eyes, giving him the free view
which is essential in a fighting scout. It may be
said that it was mainly this characteristic, that it
was good to see out of, that made the Nieuport, in
1916, the best fighting machine on either side.
Strong in construction and very handy, it could
turn inside any German aeroplane we ever encountered.
It was not very fast, but, with an
exceptionally good climb to 10,000 feet, it was no
bad “grid” on which to go Hun-hunting between
the sea and the Somme. It was armed with a
single Lewis gun carrying a double drum with
ninety rounds of .303 ammunition and two spare
drums. The gun was mounted on the top plane
and fired over the propeller at an angle slightly
above the horizontal. The earlier Nieuports were
all treated with a bright silver-coloured “dope”&mdash;the
substance used to tighten the fabric&mdash;and
when properly turned out had a very smart
appearance.</p>

<p>Another characteristic of all types was the
V-shaped interplane strut, which, although the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
Germans also used them in their D3 Albatros,
made the machines easy to recognise in the air.</p>

<p>In conclusion, the Silver Nieuport was a good
machine to fight in, but a bad one either for
running away or for catching a faint-hearted
enemy, as its best air speed, even near the ground,
rarely exceeded ninety-six or ninety-seven miles
per hour.</p>

<span class="subhead">ARRAS</span></h2>

<p class="in0">With the beginning of March 1917, the Boche
became very active in the air. The D3 V-strut
Albatros appeared in numbers on the 3rd Army
front, and about the same time a squadron of
red-painted machines of this type, known to the
R.F.C. as “the Circus,” did a good deal of damage
to British machines and annoyed us very much.
One aeroplane in particular, called the “Pink
Lady” on account of an absurd story that it was
flown by a woman&mdash;the machine itself was coloured
bright red&mdash;was often seen between Arras and
Albert. It is thought that the pilot was Freiherr
von Richthofen the elder. This machine it was
that, venturing well over our side of the line on
March 6, 1917, crashed an F.E. and went on and
engaged and shot down Evelyn Graves, whose
machine caught fire. When picked up, he was
found to have been shot through the head, so that
he was spared the pain of death by burning.</p>

<p>After Evelyn Graves’s death, A. J. L. Scott, of
the Sussex Yeomanry, was appointed to succeed
him. He was a flight commander in 43&mdash;a
Sopwith two-seater squadron&mdash;and was also lame
as the result of a crash during the early part of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
war, being the third lame squadron commander
in succession appointed to 60.</p>

<p>Scott took up his appointment on March 10,
1917, about the time that the aerial offensive
precedent to the Arras battle began to develop.</p>

<p>There had been, on the 3rd Army front, a lull
during January and February, and by a lull is
meant that pilots were doing one job a day instead
of the two that they were almost certain to be
called upon for when business was good. The
casualties lists show this clearly, as, though E. O.
Grenfell and Gilchrist were wounded in December,
there were only two more casualties until Evelyn
Graves’s death in March&mdash;R. Hopper, killed on
January 11; and E. G. Herbert, wounded on the
28th. February passed without the loss of a
single officer. This was due mainly to the month
of hard frost referred to above, which kept the
Hun machines on the ground. Even when
machines did meet in the air at this time, it was
very difficult to get the guns to fire, so that on
several occasions the pilots, after manœuvring
round one another for a while, waved hands and
went home. A non-freezing gun-oil was brought
out before the next winter, which put an end to
these not altogether unwelcome interludes to the
sterner business. Mention of Grenfell’s wound
calls to mind the occasion on which he received it.
An O.P. (offensive patrol) led by him, and consisting
of Caldwell, Daly, Whitehead, Weedon,
and Meintjies, met a two-seater Albatros over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
Dainville on our side of the line. All our machines
opened fire, and the Hun hurriedly landed. Grenfell,
anxious to get down and claim him, crashed
and broke his leg, while all the other five machines
landed, and three of these also crashed, not so
seriously as to injure the pilots, but enough to
prevent them taking off again. Thus the Hun in
one field was flanked by a crashed Nieuport in
every adjoining enclosure, while, to make matters
worse, the Boche observer&mdash;who, unlike the pilot,
was not wounded&mdash;set fire to his machine to
prevent it falling into our hands. The machine
shortly exploded, seriously injuring the observer
and several of our own infantry who by that time
were standing by. If these had grasped the
situation a little more quickly they could easily
have prevented the destruction of the machine,
which it was important to preserve.</p>

<p>The battle of Arras, as it came to be called,
was now imminent, and would probably have
commenced before April 10 but for an unexpected
move on the part of the enemy. On March 30,
the first clear day after a spell of bad weather,
the first patrol to land reported thirty or forty
fires in the tract of country east of the Arras-Albert
sector. Every village for ten or fifteen
miles back was alight. At first we could not
understand what it meant&mdash;for although an
R.F.C. squadron knew a good deal more of what
was happening than a battalion in the line, still
we did not always fully comprehend the meanings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
of the incidents we reported, which the G.H.Q.
Intelligence Staff could, no doubt, interpret with
the help of reports from their numerous other
sources of information.</p>

<p>The German retreat of March 14 came, therefore,
as a complete surprise to us. For, even at
this stage of the war, we had become so used to
hearing that the enemy’s <i>morale</i> was undermined,
and that their troops were unwilling to fight, etc.,
that we had ceased to take much notice of these
stories, the truth of which&mdash;for they were true&mdash;only
became manifest nineteen months later.</p>

<p>The next two days, the 14th and 15th, were
days of stormy weather, in spite of which patrols
were continually sent out to try and ascertain
the depth of the withdrawal and to locate the
new German positions. The rough-and-ready
way in which this was done was to fly low until
we came under fire from anti-aircraft guns or
rifles and machine guns on the ground. Molesworth,
in a letter, gives quite a graphic account
of this retreat as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="sigright">

<span class="l2">“<span class="smcap">B.E.F., France</span>.</span><br />
“<i>March 1917.</i>
</p>

<p>“No luck for me in the Hun line yet, although
the beggars seem to be running on the ground all
right.</p>

<p>“Three of us went out the other day, and had
the most hectic time. The clouds were about
3,000 feet and very dense, with gaps here and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
there. We crossed the lines and expected to get
it pretty hot from <span class="locked">Archie,<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a></span> but, strangely enough,
nothing happened. Heading towards Croisille,
we came out of a thick cloud and saw a most
extraordinary sight. For miles around every
village was a blazing mass with smoke columns,
like great water-spouts, ascending upwards to
the clouds. Along the roads one could see lines
of retreating men making for the Hindenburg
defences, which we could plainly distinguish
owing to the amount of barbed wire entanglements
round them. Suddenly we were met by a
perfect tornado of bursting ‘archies,’ and so were
forced to turn into a cloud. This cloud was so
thick that we all promptly proceeded to lose
ourselves. I looked at my <span class="locked">compass<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a></span> and saw
that it was pointing west, so carried on. At last,
after about half an hour’s flying, I found myself
alone in an opening in the clouds. Below me
were dozens of shell-holes filled with water;
round about, black clouds and sheets of driving
rain. I knew I was somewhere near the lines,
and yet could not decide in which direction to
turn. Trusting to the compass I still pushed on
west, and at last the shell-holes disappeared.
Just as my petrol was giving out I spotted some
hangars. There was nothing for it, so I decided
to land. Coming down to about 200 feet I did a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
half-circle to get into the wind, and to my utter
disgust saw a large party of Germans on the
ground. I therefore made up my mind that it
must be a Hun aerodrome. No machines were
out, owing to the ‘dud’ weather, so I landed,
jumped out of the machine, seized the Very
pistol, and was just going to fire it into the grid
when I saw, to my amazement, two mechanics in
khaki coming across to give me a hand. I tell
you, I have never been so bucked to see anyone
in khaki before. Evidently the party I had seen
were German prisoners. When the old kite
had been filled up I pushed off again, and got
home after about an hour’s run. On arrival I
heard that the other two had lost themselves as
well, but had managed to get back. In future I
shall take jolly good care to get to know the
country better before playing about in clouds.”</p></blockquote>

<p>On the 17th and 18th the weather became too
bad to fly, and an “excursion” was organised
in tenders to the nearest points of the old front line,
Ransart and Monchy-au-Bois, near Adinfer Wood;
this last-named had been the home of a peculiarly
accurate enemy “archie” gun for many months
past. At the latter place skeletons of French
soldiers still hung in the wire, where they had
been since September 1915 at least.</p>

<p>The systematic and deliberate devastation of
the evacuated country made a great impression
on all our pilots, who were also thrilled to see the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
very trenches which the enemy’s troops had
occupied only a few days earlier. It seemed
wonderful to see the marks in the muddy sides
of the trenches made by German feet and elbows,
and the clips of rifle cartridges laid on the fire
steps by their sentries less than a week before.
Absorbingly interesting, too, to explore their
dugouts, and to trace the routes by which their
troops came up into the line from the rest billets
behind. All the roads had been blown up, and
every house in each abandoned village was most
efficiently destroyed, except in a few cases, like
Bapaume town hall, where delay action mines
had been prepared.</p>

<p>One of the most impressive sights was the
German cemetery, which was to be found in almost
every hamlet, carefully laid out and extremely
carefully tended, with monuments, cement steps,
and ornamental shrubs symmetrically disposed
amid the ruins of the houses among which it stood.</p>

<p>There were souvenirs enough for an army, let
alone a squadron, and we were fortunate when
collecting them not to fall into a single “booby
trap,” such as a helmet which exploded when
picked up. This expedition is also described by
Molesworth in another letter:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="sigright">
<span class="l4">“<span class="smcap">60 Squadron R.F.C.</span>,</span><br />
<span class="l2">“<span class="smcap">B.E.F., France</span>.</span><br />
“<i>March 1917.</i>
</p>

<p>“The rumour about leave is true, so my turn
ought to come in a few days as my name is next
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>on the list. The weather has been hopeless
lately for aviation. Yesterday some of us
decided to go and have a look at the old Boche
trenches. We chose the ones west of Adinfer
Wood, as they were less likely to be mined than
those further north.</p>

<p>“Having seized a tender, we pushed off after
breakfast towards the line. We got to our front
trenches at about ten o’clock, and left the tender
here, as the road was still in pretty bad repair.
No Man’s Land was dotted about with shell-holes.
A few broken stumps of trees lined the
road&mdash;war-worn veterans that had stood the test
of battle. (Amongst other souvenirs, I am
bringing you back a walking-stick made from a
branch of one of these.) There was a wood, or
what remained of it, to our right front, as this
part of the line had been very quiet, and was
nothing compared to the utter desolation of the
Somme or ‘Arras’ battle-fields.</p>

<p>“The German system of trenches consisted of
thick belts of barbed wire, behind which was a
trench about 10 feet deep, with platforms and
machine-gun emplacements to shoot from.
About every 50 yards or so square openings led
down to the underground dugouts. The old
Hun seems to have lived fairly comfortably, as
there were beds and tables here and there, with
store-rooms and passages connecting each dugout.</p>

<p>“We went about collecting souvenirs very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
gingerly, as warnings of booby traps were posted
up everywhere we went. But luckily no one
was caught out. We managed to collect some
tin hats, bombs, Very pistols, and a few other
odds and ends, which we loaded into the tender.</p>

<p>“I am bringing some of these home.</p>

<p>“Orders have just come through for us to go
on another balloon strafe, so I will finish this
when we come back if old Fritz doesn’t stop me.</p>

bucked with life, as the Major has just told me
that I have been made a ‘flight commander.’
No time for any more, as I am just off to have a
cheery time with the other lads, who seem to
have done pretty well too.”</p></blockquote>

<p>That the enemy knew that the British intended
to attack was evident, because the numbers of
the aforementioned V-strut Albatros scouts had
obviously increased on this front. The performance
of these machines was considerably better
than the Nieuport, and they had two Spandau
guns firing through the propeller; and, moreover,
the circus of red machines led, so they said, by
Richthofen, was functioning freely throughout
the month of March 1917. It is perhaps unnecessary
to repeat that the offensive in the air commences<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
always before the push on the ground,
and though the latter was timed to commence on
April 10, 60 had a hard month to go through
before this date arrived. We were short of
scout squadrons at this time, and though 48,
the first Bristol fighter squadron, and 56, another
new squadron equipped with the S.E.5s, had
arrived from England, these were to be kept as a
surprise for the Boche, and were not to cross the
line until “zero day,” as the day fixed for the
first assault was called. With 56 Ball had come
out again from England, and it was during this
battle that he was killed, on May 7, 1917, after
a severe engagement in which Meintjies, who also
had been posted to 56 after a period of rest
at home, was badly wounded; the latter is one
of the best pilots, and almost the most popular
officer, 60 ever had.</p>

<p>The flight commanders at this time, mid-March
1917, were: K. L. Caldwell, who when on
leave fell sick and did not return till June. He
was a New Zealander, a great friend of Meintjies,
and was beloved by everyone. He was a curious
instance of a fine and fearless fighter, but a bad
shot at this time, who in consequence did not
get many Huns; he afterwards remedied this
defect and made a great reputation both in 60 and
when commanding 74 in 1918. The other two
were Alan Binnie, an Australian who had fought
with the 9th Division in Gallipoli, and Black, who
went sick and was subsequently posted away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
At the beginning of this month (on the day
before Graves’s death, to be exact) W. A. Bishop
joined. The son of a well-known family in
Montreal, he had passed through the Royal
Military College and had joined the Canadian
Cavalry, coming over with his regiment with the
first Canadian contingent. On arrival in England
he very soon applied to join the Flying Corps, and
was posted as an observer to No. 7 Squadron.
After a tour of duty in France in this capacity he
went home to learn to fly, and was posted to us
almost as soon as he had got his wings.</p>

<p>It was curious to notice how quick the mechanics
of the squadron were to recognise Bishop’s
quality. Only a few days after his arrival at the
squadron the sergeants gave a musical evening
to which the officers were invited, and it was
observed that one of the very few toasts which
were proposed by them was that of Bishop’s
health, although at this time he had only destroyed
one enemy machine, and none of his
fellow-officers had, as yet, any idea of the brilliant
career that was in store for him. This occasion,
on which he got his first Hun, was remarkable
for the fact that his engine failed, and forced him
to land very near the front-line trenches. He
only, in fact, just succeeded in scraping over.
The failure of the engine was due to his inexperience
in allowing it to choke while diving. Having
landed in a very unhealthy spot, he got rapidly
into a dugout occupied by some field gunners,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
and, with their help, moved his machine every
half-hour to prevent the German artillery shelling
it. During the night he borrowed a toothbrush
from the gunner officer, and with this contrived
to clean the sparking plugs of his engine. Having
heard nothing of him, the squadron had
already reported him missing, when he succeeded
in getting a telephone message through to say
that he was safe.</p>

<p>Our Corps machines, the eyes of the artillery,
were being shot down every day in the valley of
the Scarpe, despite our efforts and those of 29
(also with Nieuports) and 11, an F.E.2B. squadron.
The ground on both sides of the river was
littered with B.E.s. The scouts, whose losses
were much heavier, fell usually far over the lines
in hostile territory.</p>

<p>The work at this time still consisted mainly of
offensive patrols (whose business it was to
operate east of the artillery machines and to
keep the air clear of hostile scouts), reconnaissances,
and sometimes escorts to bombing and
photographic patrols. On April 7 M. B. Knowles,
C. S. Hall, and G. O. Smart&mdash;the latter was
originally an N.C.O. pilot who had but lately
been commissioned for gallantry in the Field&mdash;all
failed to return after an engagement with a much
superior force of the enemy. At this time it was
very hard to get all the photographs wanted by
the army owing to the enemy’s activity in the
air, and when special information about some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
point was required, 60 was sometimes given the
job of taking the photographs. It was thought
that the Huns would not expect a scout to be
doing photography, and they were not over-keen,
even at that time, on attacking a scout formation.
It was no easy task this, to fly a sensitive single-seater,
look out for Huns, and expose plates at
the same time, but it was done with some measure
of success. Here follows Molesworth’s description
of a fight:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="sigright">
<span class="l4">“<span class="smcap">60 Squadron R.F.C.</span>,</span><br />

“<i>April 1917.</i>
</p>

<p>“A Hun at last!</p>

<p>“We started out this morning, led by our new
squadron commander, who seems one of the
best. Our late C.O. was brought down in flames,
this side of the lines, in a scrap. He was a very
great loss to the squadron, and we buried him,
with full military honours, in a little village
cemetery near-by.</p>

<p>“There were five of us on the patrol, my position
being the rear one on the left. We got to
the lines at about 10,000 feet, and crossed them,
making towards Douai. Soon we sighted a
small patrol of <span class="locked">Sopwith<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a></span> two-seaters, north-east
of Arras, flying towards the lines as hard as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
could go, with a large pack of Huns chasing them.
The latter managed to get the last machine in
flames, the poor devils going down burning like
a furnace.</p>

<p>“The Major immediately dived for the Huns,
and I knew that I was in for my first real big
scrap. The leader saw us coming, and turned
east with his nose well down; however, we soon
caught him up and started scrapping. Then
ensued the usual <span class="locked">dog-fight.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a></span> I managed to get
well behind a Hun two-seater which was a little
way out of the scrap. He didn’t seem to mind
me plugging him a bit, and went calmly on. In
my excitement I lost my head, and started spinning
madly to the ground. Coming out, I saw
an Albatros <span class="locked">scout<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a></span> about 50 yards ahead, so
loosed off at him and saw him <span class="locked">spin<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a></span> and crash on
the ground, much to my delight.</p>

<p>“Having lost the rest of the <span class="locked">formation<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a></span> I headed
for home, and found out, on landing, that we had
accounted for three Huns. The two-seater
which I had been trying to worry was known as
the ‘Flying Pig,’ owing to the likeness of the
observer to that rotund animal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
“Talking about casualties, we have had a
pretty hot time the last few days. However,
twenty Huns have been accounted for during
this time, and many more sent down out of
<span class="locked">control,<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a></span> so we hope to put up a record in the
R.F.C.”</p></blockquote>

<p>From the last week in March to the last week
in May our losses were very severe (see Appendix
II); in fact, counting those who went sick and
those injured in crashes on our side of the line,
we lost thirty-five officers during these eight
weeks, almost twice the strength of the squadron,
which consisted of eighteen pilots and the
squadron commander. One week-end in April,
the 14th, 15th, and 16th, was especially unlucky,
as on Saturday “A” Flight went out six machines
strong (full strength) and only one returned.
Binnie was leading, and was hit in the shoulder
when trying to extricate two of his patrol from
a cloud of enemies. The blood from his wound
spurted all over the nacelle, obscuring the instruments,
and in addition his machine caught fire.
He extinguished the flames and then fainted when
gliding homeward. The machine must have
turned west after this, for he woke up in a little
park in Lens, having hit the ground while still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
unconscious, without further serious injuries.
He lost his arm at the shoulder, and was a prisoner
till the spring of 1918, when he was repatriated,
and immediately commenced flying again. He
was a very great loss to the squadron, as he was
a first-class flight commander, who had already
destroyed several Huns and would have got a lot
more. On the next day, Sunday, “B” Flight,
five strong, lost two pilots: one, Milot, a French-Canadian
Major, who was killed; the other,
Hervey, who had already gained two Military
Crosses as an observer and promised very well,
was forced to land on the other side by anti-aircraft
fire. On this patrol Bishop, who had just
been promoted captain, got two Huns and a
balloon, having had five or six combats. On
Monday “C” Flight (Bishop’s) went out without
the flight commander, and only one, Young,
returned; this meant that in three days ten out
of eighteen pilots were lost, and had to be replaced
from England by officers who had never flown
this particular type of machine, because there
were none in England. Our new machines were
collected from Paris, and the chance of a trip to
fly one back was eagerly looked forward to by
every pilot. Some of these new machines were
not well built, and began&mdash;to add to our troubles&mdash;to
break up in the air. Lieut. Grandin’s fell
to bits while diving on a hostile two-seater,
though this may have been due to injury from
machine-gun fire. Caffyn’s and Brackenbury’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
collapsed when practising firing at ground targets
on the aerodrome, and the former was killed;
while Ross’s wings folded upwards when pulling
out of a dive after firing a burst; he was badly
injured, but has since recovered. A good show
was that put up by Penny, who, when his left
lower plane came off while diving on a Hun,
contrived to fly the machine back and to land at
one of our aerodromes, and quietly reported to
the squadron commander as follows: “My
lower plane came off, so I thought I had better
land. Sorry I left the patrol, sir.” The reason
for these accidents was that badly seasoned wood
was being used by the French manufacturers,
who also allowed a lot of little screws to be
inserted in the main spars, thus weakening them
considerably. H.Q. were informed and the
matter was put right.</p>

<p>During this battle the R.F.C. began to take a
hand in the ground operations by machine-gunning
support troops during an attack. “C” Flight
led by Fry, who was given an M.C. for this, did
well on May 11, by shooting up the enemy in a
cutting east of the chemical works at Roeux, in
the valley of the Scarpe. These pilots came
back, having exhausted their ammunition, refilled
with petrol and 300 rounds, and dashed off again
to the chemical works without waiting for orders.
One of them, E. S. Howard, who was killed seven
days later on an escort to machines doing photography,
thus described this adventure:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="sigright">
“<i>May 13, 1917.</i>
</p>

<p>“On Friday night the infantry made an attack
east of Fampoux and we were told off to assist
them. When they went over the top, we dived
down and emptied our machine guns into the
Hun trenches. Our people put up a wonderful
barrage; it was good to see, but not at all nice to
fly over, as the bursts from the shells threw the
machines about. We have just come back from
a show, chased four Huns away over their lines,
and then flew round keeping our eye on them so
they could not come back.”</p></blockquote>

<p>This “low flying,” as it was called, became more
popular with the higher command, though not
with the pilots, as the war went on, and in fact,
during the German offensive of March 1918, it
was said to have very materially helped to stop
the Boche advance on the 5th and 3rd Army
fronts.</p>

<p>Hostile balloons also were constantly attacked
during April and May, and Bishop, Ross, Molesworth,
and Penny did considerable execution.
Others who were doing well at this time were
Langwill, Hall, J. Elliott, Smart, and F. Bower;
the last-named on April 2 pursued, with his patrol,
six hostile scouts a long way east of Douai
in a very strong westerly wind, and though
shot through the stomach and with his intestines
hanging out, he flew west and landed his
machine near Chipilly, completely undamaged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
except from enemy bullets. He died next day,
and his machine was flown back to the squadron
without having had to be repaired by another
pilot. A fight as a result of which R. B. Clark,
an Australian, was killed on April 30 is well
described below:</p>

“<i>April 1917.</i>
</p>

<p>“We are all feeling rather down in our luck
to-day, as news has come through that one of our
chaps has ‘gone west’ in hospital. He put up
an awfully ‘stout’ show against the Hun.</p>

<p>“It was on one of our big balloon shows. He
was attacked by three Hun scouts just after firing
at the ‘gas-bag.’ He scrapped them all the way
back to the lines, crashing one of them, and holding
the other two off. As he crossed the trenches,
one of them plugged him in the petrol tank, and
his grid caught on fire. As he was only about
50 feet up, he managed to get her down in the
shell-holes, or rather a strip of ground between
them, without burning himself badly. Luck was
all against him, however, as he just tippled over
into a trench at the end of his run. A few men
who were in an advanced dressing-station near-by
quickly came to his rescue, and hauled him clear
of the burning wreckage, but the poor devil was by
this time badly singed about the legs. He insisted
on giving his report before allowing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
doctor to attend to his burns, and the men told
me afterwards that he was extremely plucky.</p>

<p>“The day after this occurred, I was detailed to
find the machine and see if it could be salved.
The weather was absolutely vile. We started for
Arras with a tender and <span class="locked">trailer,<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a></span> got there about
noon, and commenced making inquiries as to
where the machine had crashed. One place was
pointed out to us where there was an old <span class="locked">‘quirk,’<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a></span>
which had obviously been brought down doing
artillery work. Then we were sent off in another
direction, only to find the remains of an old Boche
two-seater. At last, after an hour’s wading in
trenches with mud up to our knees and shells
bursting near us, we arrived at the advanced
dressing-station. Here we were given a full
description of the fine way in which our pilot had
fought.</p>

<p>“The machine, needless to say, was a total
wreck, and so, after a cup of tea with a drop of
gin in it to warm us up, we pushed off home,
followed by some heavy shells which we knew
meant the commencement of the ‘evening <span class="locked">hate.’”<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a></span></p></blockquote>

<p>Hardly a day passed during April and May
without Bishop destroying at least one Hun
machine, and on June 2, 1917, he visited an enemy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
aerodrome near Cambrai&mdash;a long way over&mdash;by
himself at dawn and found seven machines on the
ground with their engines running. They began
to take off and he destroyed four, returning safely
with his machine considerably shot about by
machine-gun fire from the ground. For this
exploit, after three months of remarkably fine
work, he was awarded the Victoria Cross. Others
who were prominent during the battles of Arras
and Vimy Ridge were: Pidcock, “Red” Lloyd
and “Black” Lloyd (the latter, a fine officer, was
unfortunately shot down and killed), and Fry
(who drove down a Hun on our side and found in
the pilot’s pocket a ticket for a box in Cambrai
theatre dated the day before). Molesworth also
was doing well; he afterwards went to 29 on a
second tour of duty with the R.F.C. in France
(he had already seen service overseas with the
infantry), where he did most brilliantly during
the winter of 1917&ndash;18. His account of a successful
balloon attack is given here in full:</p>

“<i>April 1917.</i>
</p>

<p>“Still more excitement! I tackled my first
balloon yesterday, and consider it even more
difficult than going for a Hun; at least, I think
one gets a hotter time. We had received orders a
week ago that all balloons <i>had</i> be to driven down
or destroyed, as they were worrying our infantry
and gunners during the advance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
“We had been practising firing the Le Prieur
<span class="locked">rockets<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a></span> for some time&mdash;a most weird performance.
One dives at a target on the ground, and
when within about fifty yards of it presses a
button on the instrument boards Immediately
there is a most awful hissing noise, which can be
heard above the roar of the engine, and six huge
rockets shoot forward from the struts each side
towards the target.</p>

<p>“We did not think these were much of a
success, owing to the difficulty of hitting anything,
so decided to use <span class="locked">tracer<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a></span> and Buckingham
bullets instead. These are filled with a compound
of phosphorus and leave a long trail of smoke
behind them.</p>

<p>“On the morning we were detailed to attack
the balloons the weather was so ‘dud’ that none
of them were up, although we went across twice
to have a look. We got a pretty hot time from
Archie, as we had to fly below the clouds, which
were about 2,000 feet, and dodge about all over
the shop. Next day the weather cleared and we
decided to carry out our strafe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
“We all went off individually to the various
balloons which had been allotted us. I am glad
to say most of us managed to do them down.
I personally crossed the trenches at about 10,000
feet, dropping all the time towards my sausage,
which was five or six miles away. It was floating
in company with another at about 3,000 feet, and
reminded me of that little song, ‘Two Little
Sausages.’</p>

<p>“I started a straight dive towards them, and
then the fun began. Archie got quite annoyed,
following me down to about 5,000 feet, where I
was met by two or three strings of flaming
<span class="locked">onions,<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a></span> luckily too far off to do any damage.
Then came thousands of machine-gun bullets from
the ground&mdash;evidently I was not going to get
them without some trouble. I zigzagged about
a bit, still heading for the balloons, and when
within two hundred yards opened fire. The old
Huns in the basket got wind up and jumped out
in their parachute. Not bothering about them, I
kept my sight on one of the balloons and saw the
tracer going right into it and causing it to smoke.</p>

<p>“As our armament consists of a Lewis <span class="locked">gun,<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a></span> I
had to now change drums. This is a pretty
ticklish job when you have about ten machine
guns loosing off at you, not to mention all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
other small trifles! However, I managed to do
it without getting more than half a dozen or so
bullet-holes in my grid.</p>

<p>“By this time the second balloon was almost
on the floor. I gave it a burst, which I don’t
think did any damage. The first sausage was in
flames, so I buzzed off home without meeting any
Huns. On the way back a good shot from Archie
exploded very near my tail, and carried away part
of the <span class="locked">elevator.<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a></span> Don’t you think this is the limit
for anyone who wants excitement? I must say
I prefer it to the infantry, as one gets decent food
and a comfortable bed every night, if you are
lucky enough to get back.</p>

<p>“I am afraid these letters are awfully full of my
own ‘shows,’ but none of the other chaps will tell
me about theirs, so I can’t describe them to you;
however, it’s much the same for all of us. Please
forgive me, and don’t think it’s swank!</p>

<p>“There are rumours that leave is going to start
again soon, so I hope to see you in a few weeks.”</p></blockquote>

<p>One day in early June General Allenby, then
commanding the 3rd Army, was to inspect the
squadron at nine o’clock in the morning. The
squadron commander had gone out by himself in
his Nieuport at dawn, unshaved, in pyjamas, a Burberry,
bedroom slippers and snowboots, a costume
which many of us used to affect on the dawn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
patrol. The line was unusually quiet that morning,
so he ventured almost to Douai, and on turning
west saw a formation of eight or nine machines
over Vis-en-Artois, near the front line, well
below him at about 8,000 feet. They turned, and
the sun glinting on the fuselage showed a bright
flash of red. This meant that they were Huns,
and not only Huns but “the Circus.” Having
the advantage of height, and as the formation
was very near the line, he determined to try
and do a little damage. He flew towards them
from the east and from the sun, and diving on
the top machine, fired a burst and pulled sharply
up, being careful to retain his height. After a
few dives of this kind without doing much apparent
damage, an S.E.5 patrol of 56, which had seen the
scrap, bustled up, and a very pretty “dog-fight”
ensued, in the course of which one of the Huns
detached himself from the mêlée and appeared
to be going home. This was the Nieuport’s
opportunity, so, hardening his heart, he dived
right in, making good shooting. The Albatros
appeared to take no notice, but flew straight on.
(In parenthesis it may be observed that this is a
good sign, as it usually means the pilot is dead,
for if the opposing machine begins to perform
frantic evolutions, the pilot is as a rule very much
alive, and not in the least “out of control.”)
Flushed with excitement, the Nieuport man put
the stick (control column) between his knees,
and going down on the tail of the Albatros, began<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
to put a fresh drum of ammunition on to his
Lewis gun, with which alone this type of machine
was armed. While thus busily engaged something
made him turn his head to see about twenty
yards behind him the white nose of a grim-looking
Albatros. Swifter than thought the Nieuport was
wrenched to the right, and even as she turned the
Albatros’s Spandau guns spat out a burst, which
riddled the engine and cut the bottom out of the
petrol tank, allowing all the remaining petrol to
pour on to the pilot’s feet. The height of both
machines at this moment was about 5,000 feet,
the locality just east of Monchy-le-Preux, and but
for the attentions of the Boche machine it would
have been comparatively easy for the Nieuport to
glide back to Arras and perch on one of our advanced
landing grounds, or on the race-course;
but with a bloodthirsty Hun on one’s tail and a
dead engine, the problem, however, was not such
a simple one. Twisting and turning like a snipe,
the Nieuport began to descend, taking care to
make his turns as much as possible towards our
side of the line. Mercifully the wind was from
the east. Close behind followed the Albatros,
firing short bursts at frequent intervals, but
always wide, because it is not easy to hit a machine
whose pilot knows you are there. It was a stout
Hun, however, who would not be denied, but continued
the chase down to 300 feet, a few hundred
yards west of Monchy-le-Preux, when he suddenly
turned and flew home to report, no doubt, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
British machine destroyed. With a gasp of
relief the Nieuport pilot turned his attention to
the ground, and, seeing nothing but shell-holes
beneath him, made up his mind that a crash was
inevitable. Suddenly a strip of ground about a
hundred yards long and very narrow, but free
from shell-holes, caught his eye, and, putting in a
couple of “S” turns, he made a good slow landing.
The machine ran on and had almost stopped
when a shell-hole appeared, and she ran very gently
into it without doing any damage whatever.</p>

<p>A couple of dusty gunners walked up and
before speaking produced a packet of Woodbines,
one of which the Nieuport pilot greedily took and
lit. Inquiries showed that an advanced anti-aircraft
section was near-by, where the officer-in-charge
gave the airman breakfast and, better still,
produced a telephone, with the help of which he
got into communication with his squadron, and
ordered a car to come straight through Arras and
up the Cambrai road. It was getting late, and
an Army Commander’s inspection was not a
thing to be treated lightly. Further inquiries
disclosed an Artillery Ammunition Column in a
little valley who lent him a horse and an orderly.
There was no saddle, but the pilot climbed gratefully
on to the animal, which had very rough
paces and a hard mouth, and set out towards the
road. In a short time he met the car and drove
furiously through Arras and back to Le Hameau,
only to see Allenby, the R.F.C. Brigade Commander<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
(General J. R. Higgins), and George Pretyman
arriving at the station. His costume being hardly
that prescribed for inspections, the wretched
officer dived into his hut, did the quickest shave
on record, and timidly approached the glittering
cortège.</p>

<p>Everyone was furious with him except General
Allenby, who was rather amused and very kind.
He got, however, a well-deserved and proper
“telling-off” from the Brigadier and Wing Commander,
and saw the troupe depart with a feeling
of profound relief.</p>

<p>The account of this scrap has been given at
some length, but it should not be assumed that
it was in any way exceptional. It should be
remembered that during the squadron’s history
there have been about 1,500 distinct combats in
the air, all of which deserve a detailed description.
Within the limits of a book of this kind,
however, it cannot be done.</p>

  <div class="caption">60 SQUADRON’S NIEUPORT SCOUTS LINED UP IN THE SNOW AT
LE HAMEAU AERODROME, NEAR ARRAS JANUARY 1917.</div></div>

<p>We made a hard tennis-court in Tetus’s orchard
with red <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">pierre de fosse</i> from the Bruay mines,
and discovered that Caldwell, Molesworth, Horn,
and both Lloyds were all good tennis players.
With the beginning of June things quietened
down on the 3rd Army front. Colonel Pretyman,
O.C. 13th Wing, put the squadron on to wireless
interception. This term needs, perhaps, a little
explanation. Everyone knows, of course, that
both German and British artillery observation
machines were fitted with wireless sets, by means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
of which the pilots corrected the shooting of the
gunners for whom they were observing.</p>

<p>These wireless messages were “tapped” by
our compass stations, and it was discovered that
two of these stations could get a cross-bearing
on any machines registering for the enemy
artillery. By linking up the compass station
with an aerodrome by telephone, it was possible
to send off a patrol of scouts to chase off or
destroy the artillery machine as soon as he began
to send down fire signals, i.e. as soon as he was
actually directing the fire of the enemy batteries.
This was useful, though exhausting work for
pilots; for the Hun, who did his registration
chiefly in the morning, when the sun was behind
him in the east, usually saw the scouts coming
before they saw him, and turned and dived three
or four miles back behind his own lines, where it
was very difficult to attack him, even if he was
visible, which usually he was not, as our scouts
were looking for a machine at five or six thousand
feet in a certain place, whereas it was probably
at that moment at a height of 1,500 feet some
five miles east of the bearing given. As soon,
therefore, as the scouts, seeing nothing, turned
back to return to the aerodrome, the Hun swung
up again and resumed his registration. The
British pilots, on returning to their aerodrome,
would find an irate squadron commander who
had just got a telephone message from the
compass station to say that V.K., or whatever
the call sign used by that particular machine
might be, was working again quite happily,
and, “What the devil was 60’s patrol doing,
anyhow?” Off the wretched patrol had to
go again, only to go through the same performance.
It is only fair to say, however, that
they did get a good many two-seaters in this
way, though the main result was, perhaps, seen
rather in the enormously decreased amount of
artillery observation the Germans were enabled
to do, than in hostile artillery machines shot
down by us.</p>

<p>This work, however, was genuinely exhausting,
as in order efficiently to answer the compass calls,
as they were termed, three or four pilots always
had to be standing by to leap into their machines
and be off the ground, in formation, inside of
two minutes. Nevertheless, they became extraordinarily
smart at this manœuvre, and answered
to the hunting horn&mdash;doubled blasts of which
were the signal at that time&mdash;as keenly as a
fashionable pack of foxhounds. Only those who
know how irritating a thing an aero engine
can be when you are in a hurry to start can
appreciate the high standard of efficiency attained
by 60’s mechanics, which made it almost
a certainty that the 120 seconds limit would
not be exceeded.</p>

<p>The next few paragraphs will show how this
manœuvre struck one of the pilots at this
time:</p>

<p>“The tennis-court we made three months ago
is now in topping condition, so we decided to get
up a tournament amongst ourselves. Yesterday

miles an hour, so I’m told. We shall probably
have a quiet time while we are getting used to
them, and only do ‘line patrols’ for the first
fortnight or so. A French <span class="locked">‘Ace’<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a></span> landed here
to-day; he says the Huns are getting a pretty bad
time down south. Jolly glad I’m not a Hun
airman these days, with men up against me like
some of our chaps. Most of them are fairly old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
hands at the game now, and we are really beginning
to properly annoy our friends across the way.
The work has been fairly hard lately: two patrols
in the morning, one generally at dawn and the
other about noon, with ‘wireless interruption’ in
the afternoon. The latter is rather a strenuous
job. This is how we work it: When a Hun
two-seater begins to register on any part of our
front, a telephone message, giving his height and
locality, is immediately sent through to the wireless
squadron. Each scout squadron in the wing
takes it in turn. As soon as the Recording <span class="locked">Officer<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a></span>
receives the message, he sounds a horn. Three of
us who are standing by in readiness immediately
jump into our machines, and the leader gets hold
of the position and height of the Hun. Then we
push off as quickly as possible to the lines, and a
sort of ‘hide-and-seek’ begins. We try if possible
to hide in the clouds and approach the Hun when
he is off his guard. He, on the other hand,
departs hurriedly into Hunland when he spots us,
and as soon as we go he comes back to carry on his
job. We then turn on him again, but he is off
like a flash, and so it goes on until the next three
machines relieve us. It is really quite amusing
at times, and, although we do not often bring our
man down, we give him such a devil of a time that
he hasn’t much of it to spare for his companions
on the ground. Our ‘stunt <span class="locked">merchant’<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a></span> is good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
at this game, and continues to add to his score,
seldom coming back without firing his red light.
He works by himself a lot now, preferring to
surprise the Hun by hiding rather than by trying
to get him in a scrap. Wish I could do the
same. I always feel so fagged after a patrol,
that I haven’t got the energy or the patience to
sit up in the clouds waiting for a chance to bag
a ‘lone Hun.’</p>

<p>“You remember the petrol tank which was so
shot up the time I was brought down? Well, I
am having it made into a topping inkstand. The
souvenirs are coming in in fine style, and I hope to
have quite a good collection by the time I see dear
old ‘Blighty’ again.”</p></blockquote>

<p>After the battle had died down the sorely tried

<p>“It is funny hearing the war again after being
on leave so long. We had quite a good crossing,
although I had a deuce of a time getting on to the
boat at Folkestone. The silly ass of a porter had
carted all my baggage on board, including the
leave warrant, which was in my British-warm
pocket. I had to persuade the <span class="locked">A.M.L.O.<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a></span> I wasn’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
a Hun spy, and, after a long discussion, he let me
on.</p>

<p>“The Major seemed pleased to have me back,
and they all had great stories to tell about our
‘stunt <span class="locked">merchant,’<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a></span> who had been putting up a
jolly good show by bringing down <span class="locked">umpteen<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a></span> Huns.
His star turn was the shooting up of an aerodrome.
He started off at dawn by himself and arrived
over the aerodrome he had planned to attack.
Finding that there was nothing doing here, he
pushed off to look for trouble elsewhere. Suddenly
he saw the hangars of another aerodrome. He
attacked these with much gusto, and when the
Huns came up to do him down, he crashed two of
them and drove another into the trees. He also
managed to flatten out a large number of
mechanics and put pukka wind up the rest. You
can imagine how the fat old Huns ran, as nothing
like this had ever happened to them before. I
believe his name has been put in for something
big in the decoration line.</p>

<p>“It has been arranged that we get one day off
in every three, which gives us a bit of spare time.
We had ours off to-day. Four of us aviated over
to Paris-Plage, near Etaples, this afternoon and
tested our grids by firing into the sea. Afterwards
we landed opposite the Hôtel Continental
and left our machines there under a guard. We
wandered about the village for a bit, and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
started for home, <span class="locked">stunting<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a></span> about to amuse the
populace, which had collected on the front to see
us off. We all got home safely just as it was
getting dark.”</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">The centre of interest had now (June 1917)
shifted to the North. The Messines Ridge had
been taken, though we heard nothing of it till it
was over, and many of the Hun <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Jagdstaffeln</i>, as
their scout squadrons were called, had moved up
to Flanders.</p>

<p>On July 22, Scott, who had been wounded in
the arm a few days before, was promoted wing
commander and sent to the XI or Army Wing of
the 2nd Brigade allotted to the 2nd Army in the
Ypres sector. C. K. Cochrane-Patrick, D.S.O.,
M.C., who had been doing brilliantly in 23
Squadron on Spads, succeeded to the command of
60, who were at that time being re-equipped with
150 h.p. S.E.5s, this being the newest type of
scouts, as the Nieuports were by then rather out
of date.</p>

<p>Not quite so much fighting was done during July
and August, as the change of machines from an
air-cooled rotary engine (the 110 h.p. Le Rhone
which had served us so well) to a 150 h.p. water-cooled
stationary (the Hispano Suisa) naturally
took some getting used to. These machines were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
again replaced in late August with 200 h.p. Hispano
Suisa S.E.5s, which, though a more powerful engine
than the 150 h.p., was much more difficult to
keep serviceable. Nevertheless, Bishop (who was
soon posted to Home Establishment&mdash;H.E., as the
R.F.C. called it), Caldwell, Rutherford, W. Jenkins
(afterwards killed in a collision with West-Thompson
over Poperinghe), Molesworth, M.C.
and bar, Hall, S. B. Horn, M.C. (whose dog Lobo
was a squadron pet), and G. Lloyd, M.C. (who was
promoted to captain and sent to 40 Squadron as
flight commander), were all distinguishing themselves
and adding to the squadron’s laurels.</p>

nearly killed:</p>

</p>

<p>“Yesterday I had the narrowest shave I’ve
ever had since I first started Boche-strafing. I
was properly caught out this time, and really
thought things were all up.</p>

<p>“We were just over the Drocourt <span class="locked">Switch,<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a></span> near
Vitry, when a dozen Huns got what you might call
‘uppish.’ We tumbled into a proper mix-up and,
as there were only five of us, the Huns managed
to break up our formation. We had arranged
that, should this happen, we were to return to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
line independently and re-form, so I started towards
Arras, following the <span class="locked">Scarpe.<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a></span></p>

<p>“Just as I was passing over Gavrelle I espied
three fat Hun two-seaters making south-east.</p>

<p>“‘Here we are, my son,’ says I to myself.
‘We’ll just hop down and put the <span class="locked">gust<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a></span> up one of
these Huns.’</p>

<p>“No sooner said than done. I pushed my nose
down and, when within range, opened fire. The
next thing I knew was a perfect hail of bullets
pouring round me. Here is a rough description
of my thoughts during the few minutes that
followed:</p>

<p>“Crackle! crackle! crackle!</p>

<p>“‘My cheery aunt! There’s a Hun on my
tail.’</p>

<p>“‘By jove! The blighter is making my grid
into a sieve. Confound him!’</p>

<p>“‘Let’s pull her up in a good climbing turn and
have a look at him.’</p>

<p>“‘Heavens! It’s “the <span class="locked">Circus.”’<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a></span></p>

<p>“‘I wonder if old Richthof is the leader. The
dirty dog nearly caught me out this time. Silly
ass! didn’t hold his fire long enough, or he’d have
made me into cold meat by now.’</p>

<p>“‘Let’s give him a dose and see how he
likes it.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
“‘Here he comes straight at me, loosing off
with both guns.’</p>

<p>“‘I hope we aren’t going to collide.’</p>

<p>“‘Missed! Bon! Everything’s A1. Wish
I’d hit him, though!’</p>

<p>“‘I must pull her round quick or he will be on
my tail.’</p>

<p>“‘Hang! I can’t shoot for toffee, but he’s
pretty “dud,” too, thank heavens!’</p>

<p>“‘Once again, boys, round with her. Let him
have it hot.’</p>

<p>“‘No good. Try again.’</p>

<p>“‘Confound it! There’s my beastly drum
empty. I must spin and change it.’</p>

<p>“‘Good enough! Now where’s the blighter?’</p>

<p>“‘My Harry! He has got me stiff this time;
here he comes down on me from the right.’</p>

<p>“Crack! crack! crack! bang! zip! zip!</p>

<p>“‘There goes my petrol tank; now for the
flames.’</p>

<p>“‘Cheero! No luck this time, you old swine.
Wait till I get you next show.’</p>

<p>“‘Here goes for the ground.’</p>

<p>“Luckily for me, my friend and his pals, who
had been watching the scrap, thought I was done
for. They therefore chucked up the sponge and
departed.</p>

<p>“I managed to pull the machine out, just
scraping over the trenches. The engine was still
running, although the petrol was pouring out all
over my legs. A few minutes afterwards the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
engine conked out altogether, and I had to land in
a field. I was immediately surrounded by a
crowd of men, who had seen the fight. Amongst
them were some artillery officers, who took me off
to their mess and offered me a ‘tot,’ which was
very thankfully received, while they sent off a
message to the squadron. The following is the
official list of damage done to my machine:</p>

<blockquote class="hang">

<p>“Six bullet holes in propeller.</p>

<p>“Cowling<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> shot away.</p>

<p>“Large holes in bottom of petrol tank and sides.</p>

<p>“Main <span class="locked">spar<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a></span> right-hand top plane broken.</p>

<p>“Rear right-hand under-carriage strut badly
damaged.</p>

<p>“Twenty-eight holes in <span class="locked">fuselage<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a></span> and ten in the
planes&mdash;two or three missing the pilot’s
seat by less than an inch.”</p></blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>During the 3rd Corps’ attack on August 19,
1917, Lieuts. Jenkins, Steele, Thompson, Rutherford,
and Sergt. Bancroft did good work shooting
up infantry in trenches and by harassing the
troops assembling for counter-attacks.</p>

<p>On September 7, 1917, the squadron was moved
up to the XI Wing to help in the battles for the
Passchendale Ridge, which were already in full
swing. Leaving the comfortable Filescamp station
and the hard tennis-court with great regret,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
they were moved into tents on Marie Capelle
aerodrome, near Cassel, where 20 Squadron was
already stationed. The 2nd and 5th Armies
were then attacking almost every day, and 60, in
addition to their ordinary work of offensive
patrols, wireless interception, etc., co-operated by
low flying and firing at troops and transport on
the ground. Twenty-five-pound Cooper bombs
were carried at this time and dropped on suitable
targets.</p>

<p>Capt. Chidlaw-Roberts, Lieuts. Rutherford,
Whiting, and I. Macgregor were now prominent,
while Patrick, himself a brilliant fighter, was
always ready to give his squadron a lead.</p>

<p>Chidlaw-Roberts got a lot of Huns during
September, and Caldwell and W. Jenkins continued
their successes of the summer, while J.
Crompton, Young, Capt. Hammersley, Lieut. W.
Sherwood, and 2/Lieut. Carter were others who
were conspicuous during the October fighting.</p>

<p>It was in September that Capt. J. K. Law, one
of the sons of Mr. Bonar Law (another of whose
sons had already been killed in Mesopotamia),
joined at Marie Capelle. He was a tiger to fight,
and, had he come through his first month, would
probably have made a great name for himself. He
did several “shows” over the line, and his
machine was shot about badly in every one of
them. On September 21, a patrol operating in
the neighbourhood of Roulers, led by Hammersley
and including Whiting and Macgregor and Law,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
saw twenty-four hostile machines and engaged
eight of them. A general engagement took place,
in the course of which Law was shot down and
killed. He had absolutely refused to stay any
longer at home, where he was doing most useful
work training pilots, but insisted on being sent
to France.</p>

<p>Life was less easy during the autumn, as the
Boche had begun continually to send over night-bombing
machines. Our scouts were not very
successful in dealing with them, for it is very
difficult to see another machine in the air at night
even though it may be visible from the ground;
and, although several attempts were made at this
time by 70 and 29 Squadrons, stationed at
Poperinghe, to attack these night bombers, they
never succeeded in engaging one. The chief
difficulty was that one could not ask pilots and
mechanics to work all night as well as all day. If
it had been possible to take a scout squadron or
two off day work and set them to deal only with
the German night bombers, there is little doubt
but that they would have achieved some measure
of success in spite of the shortage of searchlights.
The authorities, however, would not hear of this,
as there was too much to be done by day to spare
one of our none too numerous fighter squadrons
for night work. Much later in the war, July 1918
to be exact, 151 Squadron was sent out equipped
with Camels fitted for night flying, and this
squadron alone very nearly exterminated the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
Boche night bombers on the 1st and 3rd Army
fronts. It was in this squadron that D. V.
Armstrong added so greatly to the reputation
he had already gained, and it was with them
that he was killed. As things were, however,
in 1917 the enemy dropped their bombs nightly
almost with impunity, as anti-aircraft fire was
not very effective at night, and machine-gun fire
from the ground was useless against machines
which rarely flew lower than 5,000 feet.</p>

<p>During this autumn series of battles a somewhat
novel system of message-dropping was tried. All
scout pilots were ordered to carry cards conveniently
fixed in the nacelle, on which they wrote
such information as they had secured during low-flying
patrols; special attention was to be given
to the massing of enemy supporting troops and to
the development of counter-attacks, the symptoms
of which were the approach to the <span class="locked">“debussing”<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a></span>
points of motor transport vehicles or trains from
which troops could be seen disembarking and
forming up. These cards were slipped into a
message bag and dropped in a field marked with
a white cross, near Locre Château, not far from
the line, which was the 2nd Army report
centre. The information thus given occasionally
enabled our heavy artillery to direct their fire
on to the targets indicated. On one occasion,
in October, a pilot reported a big gun being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
moved along a road near Menin; the Corps
heavies opened on it within ten minutes of the
message being dropped, and another pilot of
another squadron reported, half an hour later,
a heavy gun at the same place to have been
destroyed by a direct hit. Information of this
kind was very necessary, as the German policy
at that time was to hold their front line positions
lightly against our initial assaults, but to
counter-attack very strongly and swiftly about
two hours or so after our first attack had been
delivered.</p>

<p>Lieuts. F. Soden, W. Rutherford, and W.
Duncan all distinguished themselves by giving
accurate information during these battles, while
Selous, a son of the big-game hunter, was also
proving himself to be a fine patrol leader and Hun-getter.</p>

<p>The last-named&mdash;the worthy son of a famous
father&mdash;was killed on January 4, 1918, while
leading his patrol. He dived at some enemy
machines several thousand feet below, and in the
middle of his dive, the speed of which the other
members of the patrol estimated at not less than
300 miles per hour, the wings of his S.E.5 came
right off.</p>

<p>As good a flight commander as ever we had, he
was a very great loss to the squadron. Without,
perhaps, the brilliance of Ball or Bishop he, like
Caldwell, Summers, Armstrong, Hammersley,
Chidlaw-Roberts, Belgrave, and Scholte, to name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
a few only of the best, played always for the
squadron, and not for his own hand. He took
endless pains to enter young pilots to the game,
watching them on their first patrols as a good and
patient huntsman watches his young hounds.</p>

<p>The character of Selous, like those whom I have
mentioned, not to speak of many others whom
their comrades will remember, attained very
nearly to the ideal of a gentleman’s character as
described by Burke, Newman, and Cavendish in
the extracts given below, for which I am indebted
to a report by Lord Hugh Cecil on the education
of the future R.A.F. officer. These noble sentiments
so fully describe the kind of man the
British love and admire that it is perhaps not
inappropriate to quote them:</p>

<blockquote>

<h3>“<i>Character of a Gentleman</i></h3>

<p>“But the age of chivalry is gone. That
of sophisters, economists, and calculators has
succeeded; and the glory of Europe is extinguished
for ever. Never, never more shall we
behold that generous loyalty to rank and sex,
that proud submission, that dignified obedience,
that subordination of the heart, which kept alive,
even in servitude itself, the spirit of an exalted
freedom. The unbought grace of life, the cheap
defence of nations, the nurse of manly sentiment
and heroic enterprise is gone! It is gone, that
sensibility of principle, that chastity of honour,
which felt a stain like a wound, which inspired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
courage whilst it mitigated ferocity, which ennobled
whatever it touched, and under which
vice itself lost half its evil, by losing all its
grossness.</p>

<p>“This mixed system of opinion and sentiment
had its origin in the ancient chivalry; and the
principle, though varied in its appearance by the
varying state of human affairs, subsisted and
influenced through a long succession of generations,
even to the time we live in. If it should
ever be totally extinguished, the loss, I fear, will
be great. It is this which has given its character
to modern Europe. It is this which has distinguished
it under all its forms of government, and
distinguished it to its advantage, from the states
of Asia, and possibly from those states which
flourished in the most brilliant periods of the
antique world. It was this which, without confounding
ranks, had produced a noble equality,
and handed it down through all the gradations of
social life. It was this opinion which mitigated
kings into companions, and raised private men
to be fellows with kings. Without force or
opposition, it subdued the fierceness of pride and
power; it obliged sovereigns to submit to the
soft collar of social esteem, compelled stern
authority to submit to elegance, and gave a
dominating vanquisher of laws to be subdued by
manners.”</p>

<p>“Hence it is that it is almost a definition of a
gentleman to say that he is one who never
inflicts pain. This description is both refined
and, as far as it goes, accurate. He is mainly
occupied in merely removing the obstacles which
hinder the free and unembarrassed action of
those about him; and he concurs with their
movements rather than takes the initiative himself.
His benefits may be considered as parallel
to what are called comforts or conveniences in
arrangements of a personal nature: like an easy-chair
or a good fire, which do their part in dispelling
cold and fatigue, though nature provides
both means of rest and animal heat without them.
The true gentleman in like manner carefully
avoids whatever may cause a jar or a jolt in the
minds of those with whom he is cast&mdash;all clashing
of opinion or collision of feeling, all restraint or
suspicion, or gloom, or resentment; his great
concern being to make everyone at their ease and
at home. He has his eyes on all his company;
he is tender towards the bashful, gentle towards
the distant, and merciful towards the absurd; he
can recollect to whom he is speaking; he guards
against unseasonable allusions, or topics which
may irritate; he is seldom prominent in conversation
and never wearisome. He makes light of
favours when he does them, and seems to be
receiving when he is conferring. He never speaks
of himself except when compelled, never defends
himself by a mere retort; he has no ears for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
slander or gossip, is scrupulous in imputing
motives to those who interfere with him, and
interprets everything for the best. He is never
mean or little in his disputes, never takes unfair
advantage, never mistakes personalities or sharp
sayings for arguments, or insinuates evil which he
dare not say out. From a long-sighted prudence
he observes the maxim of the ancient sage, that
we should ever conduct ourselves towards our
enemy as if he were one day to be our friend.
He has too much good sense to be affronted at
insults, he is too well employed to remember
injuries, and too indolent to bear malice. He is
patient, forbearing, and resigned, on philosophical
principles; he submits to pain, because it is
inevitable, to bereavement, because it is irreparable,
and to death, because it is his destiny. If
he engages in controversy of any kind, his disciplined
intellect preserves him from the blundering
discourtesy of better, perhaps, but less
educated minds; who, like blunt weapons, tear
and hack instead of cutting clean, who mistake
the point in argument, waste their strength on
trifles, misconceive their adversary, and leave
the question more involved than they find it.
He may be right or wrong in his opinion, but he
is too clear-headed to be unjust; he is as simple
as he is forcible, and as brief as he is decisive.
Nowhere shall we find greater candour, consideration,
indulgence: he throws himself into the
minds of his opponents, he accounts for their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
mistakes. He knows the weakness of human
reason as well as its strength, its province, and
its limits. If he be an unbeliever, he will be too
profound and large-minded to ridicule religion or

venerable, beautiful, or useful, to which he does

<p>On November 8, Pope, an old member of the
squadron, who had come through the Arras battle
with us, destroyed two hostile two-seaters in one
day. This was a good pilot and a popular officer,
who for some reason was a long time before he
began to get Huns, but, having once found his
form, became a very useful and formidable
fighter. He went home soon after this, and
showed himself to be an exceptionally gifted
trainer of pilots, both in flying and fighting.</p>

<p>On November 20 the Cambrai attack was
launched by the 1st and 3rd Armies, and the
pressure in the air on the Passchendale sector
became sensibly less. This meant that the low-flying
patrols, which were extra to the ordinary
O.P. work, ceased for the time being, a relief
which was very welcome because low flying was
never popular, the pilot being not only exposed
to very severe fire from the ground, but also,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
being so low, was at a disadvantage when meeting
enemy machines, who could dive upon him at
their leisure, and frequently availed themselves
of this privilege.</p>

<p>By this time they had made themselves quite
comfortable at Marie Capelle, and the necessary
precautions had been taken to give protection
against bombs. It is really remarkable how soon
a good squadron will make itself at home in a new
station, and how, if all ranks work together,
messes, recreation rooms, and a theatre rise up
like pumpkins. Sixty could always make themselves
comfortable, as the following extracts from
the letters of 2/Lieut. R. W. Maclennan will
show. These letters have been collected and
published, after Maclennan’s death from wounds
on December 23, 1917, by his father, a well-known
Toronto barrister, who has courteously allowed
them to be reprinted. They describe his arrival
at the squadron from the base:</p>

<p>“When the tender came we collected our
kit and started on a long cold ride to the aerodrome,
which we reached in three-quarters of an
hour. The first thing was to report to the
squadron commander, a captain who last
summer had been one of my instructors. He
was in temporary command in the absence of
the Major, who was on leave, but has since<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
returned. When we went to the mess we ran
into a lot more of Central Flying School boys,
who had been there in our time. There are
about twenty-four officers in the squadron, and
more than half of these are Canadians, so I feel
quite at home. As a new-comer I shall not get
much flying during the first fortnight. I shall
do all I can round the aerodrome for practice, so
that when the time comes for me to go over the
line I shall know something about it.</p>

<p>“Of all the S.E.5 squadrons in France, we seem
to have struck the best. It is one which has done
exceedingly well in the past. Both the late
Captain Ball and Major Bishop belonged to it, and
there have been fewer casualties than in any other
similar <span class="locked">squadron.<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a></span> Having had so few, the chaps
have been in the game a long time, and so have
had wide experience, and this is bound to be of
inestimable benefit to new people. The aerodrome
is a good twenty miles behind the line, and
is practically immune from shell fire. None have
landed anywhere near for months.</p>

<p>“You ought to see our quarters. I share a hut
with three others and we have lots of room. The
huts are like half a barrel laid on the ground; the
curved roof is corrugated iron and the ends are
wood. We have several tables, comfortable
chairs, our camp beds, and innumerable rugs on
the floor. A coal stove and an oil stove give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
plenty of heat, and petrol lamps give excellent
light. I have not had such comfortable permanent
quarters since leaving Canada, and yet we
are within sound range of the guns, which never
cease. I was able to bring over practically every
article of kit I possessed. An infantry officer
would have had to leave nine-tenths of it behind.</p>

<p>“One great comfort is that here we can wear
just exactly what we like. We can come to
breakfast in pyjamas and wear comfortable old
clothes all day long. Puttees I am discarding for
good, and in their place will wear long stockings.
They have always been an abomination, as their
tightness stops circulation and induces cold. We
do not wear belts and can fly in sweaters. In
fact, it will be a long summer holiday with lots of
excitement thrown in. Leave comes round every
three months, and lasts for fourteen days.”</p></blockquote>

<p>“To add to the comfort of the mess, besides
dogs, we have a fairly good piano and a gramophone.
Every time anyone goes on leave he
brings back a few records, and the collection is
now quite large.</p>

<p>“The hours for actual flying are of necessity
short on account of the shortness of daylight.
Consequently we get lots of time for exercise,
most of which consists in kicking a Rugby ball<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
around the aerodrome. It is about the best way
of keeping warm in these cold days.</p>

<p>“Our tenders frequently run to St. Omer and
even as far as Boulogne, so when not flying there
are chances of seeing these places. It does seem
funny to be able to go from practically the
trenches to Boulogne (within sight of England)
almost any time we want to. We in the R.F.C.
are about the only people who can do this.</p>

<p>“When artillery horses are in need of rest, they
are sent back from the front line. We have two
or three at the squadron, and I shall probably get
some riding if I can pluck up courage enough to
try.</p>

<p>“It is bound to be muddy here before the
winter is over; at present everything is dry. In
preparation for later we have ‘duck-boards,’ or
wooden slat-walks, laid down between all the huts,
the mess, the hangars, etc. On a dark night it is
rather a problem to keep on these boards. This
reminds me that my little pocket flash lamp is
almost indispensable out here.</p>

<p>“All the heavy labour in this part of France is
now being done by Chinese coolies, brought
specially from China for this purpose. They are
enlisted as soldiers and wear a peculiar blue
padded uniform. They are employed around the
aerodrome levelling ground, putting sand-bags
about the huts as a protection against bombs,
making roads and paths, etc. They are terribly
interested in our phonograph, and if we leave the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
door open they almost come in. To keep them
out, the interpreter has painted a large sign in
Chinese characters, and it sticks up in front of the
mess and gives it quite an Oriental appearance.</p>

<p>“Moving picture shows are given every night
or so in a Church Army hut in the camp. We had
several good films last night. It hardly seems at
all like war yet.”</p></blockquote>

the ground. Two fresh pilots have been posted
to the squadron since Hemsworth and I arrived,
and we shall probably commence flying to-morrow
if the weather is suitable.</p>

<p>“Great interest is being shown out here in the
coming general election in Canada, and the
authorities are endeavouring to have every
Canadian register his vote. Quite contrary to
army precedent and regulations, the authorities
are openly urging everyone to vote against
Laurier. Most of us share this view, but it is
interesting to see the officials of an army in the
field canvassing votes for one party.</p>

push.</p>

<p>“Since last Sunday I have been waiting,
waiting, waiting for a flight, and not till last
Thursday did I get it. The day was cloudy and
the visibility poor. Hemsworth and I were to
have a practice flight, and we spent about twenty
minutes at it. When we finished, I had lost sight
of the aerodrome and so had he, for I could see
him flying aimlessly one way and then another,
diving on one hill and then on several more. As
our aerodrome is near a town perched on a high
hill, I knew what he was looking for, but none of
the hills seemed to be the right one. After that
he flew east for a time, and, although I knew such
a course would take us into Hunland, I followed,
deciding to go with him as far as the trenches and
then turn west again. Just our side of the line I
spotted a <span class="locked">town<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a></span> which I recognised from the great
relief map we had at Oxford. It is a town that
has undergone more shelling than any other during
the whole war. I never saw such a sight of
desolation. Nothing but shell-holes in all directions.
Practically all the buildings in ruins, and
every now and then a shell would burst in the
desolate city with a blinding flash. Of course, I
could hear nothing of the explosion. I knew my
way back to the aerodrome and felt much relieved,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>as it is most undignified to get lost on one’s first
flip. I opened my engine and soon caught up the
other machine, and signalled Hemsworth to turn
round and follow me. We were at the aerodrome
twenty minutes later. I have not been in the
air since owing to a temporary shortage of
machines.</p>

<p>“... The little <span class="locked">town<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a></span> near our aerodrome,
perched on a high hill, has a fine square, from
which a beautiful church can be seen, and the
square and streets are cobbled. The road which
leads into the town from the east enters through
a short tunnel, which emerges right into the square
itself. When I was last there, several howitzer
batteries were coming from the line for a rest, and
the caterpillar tractors, which haul these huge guns,
were grunting and chugging from the tunnel into
the town, and through it, making for some spot
further to the rear. All units which come out of
the trenches for a rest are sent far enough back to
be out of earshot of the guns. The Casino, at the
highest part of the town, is devoted to military
purposes. From it a wonderful view of the
Western Front may be had, puffs of smoke in the
distance, captive sausage observation balloons,
aeroplanes, and roads teeming with hundreds and
hundreds of motor-lorries slowly crawling along.
A batch of miserable-looking German prisoners
were engaged in cleaning the streets. Their
appearance gave the impression that they must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
have been reduced to sorry straits before their
capture, as they all looked white, pinched, and
sickly. I think they are pretty fairly treated by
our people, and certainly given enough to eat.</p>

<p>“Speaking of food reminds me that you may
be interested to know that we do pretty well in our
mess. I quote from our ordinary dinner menu:
Soup (mock turtle), toast; fish (grilled sole,
mustard sauce); entrée (beefsteak, pastry, boiled
potatoes, green peas); sweets (stewed prunes,
cornstarch pudding); biscuits, cheese, coffee.
Does this satisfy you? It does me.</p>

<p>“We have the correct number of machines, six in
each flight, and there are three flights, ‘A,’ ‘B,’ and
‘C.’ I am in ‘B’ Flight. There are eighteen pilots,
an equipment officer who is also quartermaster, a
recording officer (adjutant) and the commanding
officer. So we have twenty-two in our mess.</p>

<p>“Lunch is served at one o’clock. Sometimes
I have spent the afternoons walking in the near-by
town. Tea is at 4 p.m., and now it is dark at that
time. After tea we read or play cards till dinner,
at 7.30. After dinner some music. By the way,
we have a ragtime band, composed of a piano, a
snare drum, two sets of bones, a triangle and brass
cymbals, and an auto horn. It is ‘some’ band.
We all go to bed fairly early.”</p>

<p>Patrick was transferred to H.E. on December
29, 1917, to take up an appointment in the Training
Division of the Air Board&mdash;as it was then&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>and
Major B. F. Moore, Royal Warwickshire
Regiment and R.F.C., was given the command.</p>

<p>It was about this time, also, that General
Trenchard went home to become Chief of the Air
Staff, prior to the official formation of the Royal
Air Force by the amalgamation of the R.F.C. and
R.N.A.S. His successor to the command of the
R.F.C. in the field was General Sir J. Salmond,
who remained in this position till the end of the
war.</p>

<p>January 1918 passed fairly quietly. Morey
collided in the air with an Albatros scout during
a fight and both pilots must have been killed, but
as this was some way over the lines, we never heard
the German pilot’s fate. Up to this time, the Huns
had been very good in sending information about
the fate of our pilots, nor were we behind them in
courtesy. On one occasion, during May 1917, a
message was dropped on Douai aerodrome, two
hours after his capture, announcing the safety of a
German scout pilot whom we had driven down
near St. Pol. A study of the lists sent over by the
Germans showed that just over 50 per cent. of
our missing airmen were alive&mdash;wounded or
injured most probably&mdash;but alive. Later, after
March 1918, these amenities were not so nicely
observed and information became harder to get.
February came and went with the squadron still
at Marie Capelle. A. C. Ball, brother of Albert
Ball, was missing on the 5th of this month. He
was a very promising young officer, but it was too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
early in his flying career to say that he would
have rivalled his brother. Happily he is alive,
and was repatriated at the end of the war.
Lieuts. H. Crompton and W. Duncan, 2/Lieuts. H.
Hegarty and V. Priestly may perhaps be mentioned
as fighting most pluckily and well during
this month. Soden, by now a flight commander,
did a good show on February 5, 1918. He
attacked an Albatros scout, which he drove
down out of control, and was then attacked by
two other hostile machines, who drove him down
from 15,000 to 50 feet, eight miles over the line;
he came back “hedge-hopping” and banking
round trees, and when halfway home saw the
leading Hun crash into a tree; he then began
to gain on the other, and, finally outdistancing
him, crossed the trenches, still at 50 feet, and
came home.</p>

<p>On February 18, Hammersley, Clark, Evans,
and Kent took on four triplanes and got three of
them, Evans and Clark sharing one, and Kent
and Hammersley taking one each.</p>

<p>During the last month, before moving south,
a lot of work was done, and a great many bombs
were dropped from a low altitude on rest billets
and other targets, this form of annoying the Hun
having become fashionable.</p>

<p>Another unusual incident occurred when W.
Kent opened fire, one day in March, at an enemy
scout with both guns from a distance of about 400
yards. Usually it was considered complete waste<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
of ammunition to shoot at ranges exceeding 100
yards, while 10 or 15 yards was the really effective
distance. This scout caught fire all right, however,
and crashed in our lines. Bishop did a
similar thing once in the summer of 1917, but it
was not a practice that was encouraged.</p>

<p>Hammersley was still doing very well, while
J. A. Duncan, H. D. Crompton, and J. S. Griffiths
were all prominent during March. H. H. Balfour,
now commanding a flight in 43, but
an original member of 60, was adequately
maintaining the high standard which was expected
of one who had served in the squadron.</p>

<p>The S.E.5A., with which the squadron was
equipped from July 1917 till the Armistice,
deserves some description. A single-seater fighting
scout, it was armed with a Lewis gun mounted
on the top plane like the Nieuport, but carried,
in addition, a Vicker’s firing through the propeller.
Its speed, with the 200 h.p. Hispano
engine, would reach 130 miles per hour near the
ground and was, in consequence, at least 25 miles
per hour faster than the Nieuport. This increase
of speed made a great difference, as it meant that
the enemy could not run away, and, further, that
the S.E.5, if caught at a disadvantage, could outdistance
its adversaries. Against the advantage
gained in speed by this change must be set off a
certain loss in respect of power to manœuvre
quickly, but, in spite of this, the change was very
greatly to the pilot’s advantage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
Every machine has its strong and its weak points,
and though at first we found the S.E. heavy on
the controls and sluggish on her turns, and though
some were inclined to regret the silver Nieuports,
yet we soon found that the former was a far
better fighting instrument. In actual weight the
S.E., when fully loaded (including the pilot), was
about 700 lb. heavier than the Nieuport&mdash;roughly
2,000 lb. as against 1,300 lb. The new
machine, too, was distinctly more difficult to
land, as the under-carriage was relatively a good
deal weaker, and, owing to the extra weight, she
would run on much farther on the ground.</p>

<p>During the first few months, therefore, a great
many machines were crashed on the aerodrome,
more particularly after leaving Izel le Hameau,
which was a beautiful landing ground, and moving
to Marie Capelle, where there was not nearly so
much room. There were more crashes in this
period than we had had since the days of the
Morane “bullets,” and from this point of view we
often regretted the little Nieuport, which a good
pilot could put down on a postage stamp anywhere.</p>

<p>“There is no doubt that scout pilots have the
most exciting experiences while flying over Hunland,
and it sometimes happens that these
experiences may be their last. Always they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
face to face with death in one form or another,
always the thread suspending the ‘sword of
Damocles’ may break and they may be hurled
into eternity. However, we do not think of
these sort of things in the air, but instead, we are
filled with the spirit of confidence in our machines,
and the ever-present thought that the best way
to defend is to attack.</p>

<p>“There is the feeling of joy about it all which
is sometimes mixed with loneliness. You are
flying between a huge expanse of earth or sea
below, merging into the vast spaces of the heavens
above. The continuous drone of the engine in
front of you and the whistling of the wind
through the wires all add to this sense of loneliness,
while the bracing air, and the knowledge
that you have some of the finest machines and
companions in the patrol, make you feel that
flying is absolute perfection.</p>

<p>“Sometimes, however, you have a rude awakening,
either in the form of a ‘wop’ from Archie,
or the ‘rat-tat-tat-tat’ of a watchful enemy’s
machine gun, or again a sickening check in the
rhythmic beat of your engine.</p>

<p>“This last experience happened to me a few
days ago when I was leading a patrol of five
machines about three miles over Hunland, at
12,000 feet. No Huns seemed to be about.
Either Archie had forgotten our existence, or
there was too much ground mist for him to see
us. It was a perfect day up top, with a few light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
clouds floating about. Away to the north-east
we could just distinguish the town of Douai,
while far below us the intricate system of the
Hindenburg Line, with its Drocourt-Quéant
Switch, stretched like a great ‘T’ over the
shell-marked country.</p>

<p>“We were cruising along quietly, doing about
1,050 revolutions, when suddenly there was a
shattering noise in front of me, and I saw my
cowling break away in bits. Parts of it went
through the planes, luckily doing no vital damage.
Of course the engine stopped dead, and so I had
to put her nose down for home. It was quite
impossible to reach any of our aerodromes, so I
made towards Bapaume, keeping my eyes open for
a good landing ground all the time. The needle
on my altitude dial began to drop&mdash;11,000, 10,000,
9,000&mdash;with corresponding wind-up on my part,
until we were about 2,000 feet from the ground.
I knew it meant a crash if I didn’t make a good
landing, as the engine was absolutely <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">hors de
combat</i>. Suddenly I caught sight of a Bessoneau
<span class="locked">hangar,<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a></span> and near it an F.E. Bird perched on the
ground. I did a <span class="locked">side-slip,<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a></span> and landed into
wind, putting the machine down with rather a
bump; however, there was nothing seriously
damaged. Luckily the wind was blowing from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
the north, otherwise I don’t think I could ever
have got across the lines.</p>

<p>“It turned out that the place where I had
landed was an advanced F.E.8 landing ground.</p>

<p>“After going over my engine, I found that a
tappet rod had broken and stripped the cowling.
I telephoned over to the aerodrome and told them
to bring out a spare engine and cowl. They soon
arrived, and had the machine ready for me by the
afternoon, so I pushed off home and arrived safely
back soon after.”</p></blockquote>

<p>“The heat is simply terrific, and the only ways
of keeping cool are flying or sitting under the trees
in the orchard. We spend most of the day, when
not in the air, in multi-coloured pyjamas, some
lads even going so far as to fly in them.</p>

<p>“Another awfully good way of keeping cool is
to dig a hole about a foot deep and 3 feet
long and cover it with a ground-sheet, pegged
down at the corners, so as to make a bath. You
lie in this with a book and a cooling drink by your
side, and if you are lucky enough to escape the
bombardment of mud, stones, and various other
missiles which are thrown at you by the more
energetic and lively spirits in the camp, you can
really enjoy yourself. These baths have been
such a success that we decided to dig a small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
bathing-pool about 20 feet square by 3 feet
deep. When we got this going the whole population
of the nearest village had to come and
watch us. This was rather disconcerting, as we
used to bathe <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">tout à fait nude</i>. Most of the chaps
managed to rig up something in the way of a
bathing-dress by buying various articles of clothing
in the neighbouring village&mdash;I was forced to
content myself with a type of female undergarment,
which seemed to cause great amusement
amongst the <span class="locked">ack-emmas.<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a></span></p>

<p>“The village maidens were highly delighted, and
thought it quite the thing, now that we were
decently clad, to watch us at our aquatic sports.</p>

<p>“We three flight commanders have decided to
take over a Nissen hut and knock out the partition
so as to make it into one room; of course, some
wags had to start painting things on the outside.
They began by printing on the window in large
black letters, ‘Saloon Bar’; and ended by naming
the hut the ‘Hôtel du Commerce,’ as most of the
squadron seemed to collect there, including Kate
and Black Boy (the special pet dogs of the
squadron), who made it their abode.</p>

<p>“I don’t think I told you in my last letter that
one of my pilots nearly finished me off. I was
leading a patrol, when, without any warning, he
dived about four yards in front of me. We would
have collided if I hadn’t managed to yank my
machine over on her back. He successfully put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
the wind up me, I can tell you, and I gave it to him
pretty hot when we got down.”</p></blockquote>

<p>“I hope it will be ‘dud’ to-morrow, as I want
to supervise the painting of my grids. We have
all got the craze of having them coloured. Mine
are going to have red, white, and blue wheels. Our
crack flight <span class="locked">commander<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a></span> has had a spinner made
and painted blue, which he says puts the wind up
the Huns. I should think they must be getting
to know him well now, as he has crashed twenty-five
of them, two of which he got in flames
yesterday. He always lets us know when he has
got one by firing a red Very light over the
aerodrome before landing.</p>

<p>“Talking about colours, you ought to see the
Huns. They are just like butterflies, with bright
red bodies, spotted wings, and black and white
squares on their tails, or else a wonderful mauve
colour with green and brown patches.</p>

<p>“It was our day off yesterday, so the <span class="locked">Major<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a></span>
asked me to go for a ride with him. We borrowed
horses from a cavalry depot near-by, and set out
in his car for the rendezvous where we were to
pick them up. We did not intend to go far, but
lost our way in a wood. The Major is a keen
horseman and, consequently, led me over all sorts
of obstacles, such as fallen trees, etc. Not having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
ridden for three years, I found it rather a job to
stick on; however, I got used to it. We went up
and down vertical banks, and eventually had to
get the nags over a 3-foot jump, which we
managed to do with a bit of coaxing. Soon after
we arrived at the beautiful old château of Lucheux,
where we were to meet the car. This château was
used by Marlborough during the Flanders Wars.
It is now a Red Cross hospital. We had a talk to
the sisters, and wangled some topping roses out of
them for the mess. The car was waiting for us,
so we got into it and drove home.</p>

<p>“When we arrived back, we found the mess
decorated with branches of trees, which made it
look like a greenhouse. This was to commemorate
the Major’s M.C., which he has just been awarded
for bringing down Huns. We had a tremendous
‘bust’ in the evening in which the Major joined.
Speeches were made wishing him the best of luck,
and then we retired to the ante-room and had a
good old rag.”</p></blockquote>

<p>“Rotten luck!</p>

<p>“Everything is black to-day. The <span class="locked">Major<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a></span> has
been wounded in the arm; one of my best <span class="locked">pilots<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a></span>
is going off to another squadron as a flight
commander, and I missed an absolute ‘sitter’
this morning on our side of the line. However,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
every cloud has a silver lining. This time it is
in the shape of an M.C. for one of our flight
commanders who thoroughly deserves it. He
hasn’t managed to get a big bag yet, but there is
lots of the ‘good stuff’ in him, in both senses of
the word.</p>

<p>“We are going to have a great ‘bust’ to-night to
commemorate it, and to cheer things up a bit.
The show on which the Major was hit was a pretty
hot mix-up. We were in the middle of our tennis
tournament when word came through that a large
formation of Huns was on the line. It was ‘A’
Flight’s turn for a job, so they pushed off, accompanied
by the Major. They got into a big ‘dog-fight,’
and a Hun, who wasn’t in the show at all,
took a pot shot at long range and hit the Major in
the arm, breaking up his switch at the same time.
However, he managed to get back to the aerodrome
all right, and went off to hospital soon after.</p>

<p>“We got into another big show on the 11th,
and scrapped hard for about twenty minutes over
the Hindenburg Line, without any luck. At last
one of the Huns, with more guts than the rest,
came over and began to attack one of our grids. I
nipped in behind him without being seen and gave
him a dose of lead. I must have hit his guns or
something, as he had no ginger left, and simply
flew west across the lines, intending to land on our
side. Of course, my stupid old gun had to stop,
and I discovered, to my annoyance, that there was
no ammunition left. Seeing that I didn’t fire, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
Hun guessed that something was up and turned
back. I felt absolutely wild to see him calmly
sneak off into a cloud on his way home.</p>

<p>“On another occasion, when three of us were
attacking a formation of six Huns, one of us had
a most extraordinary escape. We had our noses
down, going full out to try and catch the blighters,
when suddenly the Hun directly under us did a
sharp turn. The chap on my right yanked his
grid over after him. He pulled her over with such
a jerk that one of his bottom planes came off and
fluttered down to the ground in two bits. I
couldn’t see what happened to him after that, as
we were getting to close quarters with the Huns.
We tried to scrap them, but hadn’t any luck, as
they wouldn’t put up a fight.</p>

<p>“When we arrived home, I reported that one
of my <span class="locked">patrol<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a></span> had ‘gone west,’ as I had seen him
break up in the air. Hardly had I finished when,
to my amazement, he appeared outside the
window. I could not believe my eyes and thought
it was his ghost, but he turned out to be flesh and
blood, and so we went to the mess and had a drink
on the strength of it.</p>

<p>“He told me that he had managed to fly his
kite back with great difficulty. Luckily the top
planes had held. Of course, when he landed, the
machine turned over and crashed, but he crawled
out unhurt.</p>

<p>“We three flight commanders went to see the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
Major in hospital yesterday. He seemed in the
best of spirits, and had been trying to ‘pump’ a
Hun observer, who was in his ward, by asking him
whether he liked doing artillery work on our part
of the front, but the old Boche wouldn’t give him
an answer.</p>

<p>“We all hope to have the Major back with us
soon, as his arm is much better. We miss him
‘some,’ as he often comes with us on our patrols.</p>

<p>“Charlie Chaplin isn’t in it now with us! We
were cinematographed the other day. Some of
us stood in a row and tried to look pleasant and
unconcerned, but this was rather difficult, as
everyone else was making rude remarks about us.
We then bundled into our new grids, which we
have just got, and started off on a stunt formation,
nearly running down the old cinema man to put
the wind up him. After we had done a circuit,
my radiator began to boil, and I was forced to
come down. Thank heavens! it was a good
landing, as the old man was still at it turning the
handle. My part of the show was to be known as
‘Pilot landing for more ammunition after fierce
fight.’”</p></blockquote>

have been hard at work training and doing line
patrols.</p>

<p>“Three of us, led by our famous <span class="locked">‘Hun-strafer,’<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
used them over the lines for the first time on the
5th. As a rule we only fight in flights, but on
certain occasions we volunteer for a ‘circus,’ that
is a mixed formation generally composed of the
best pilots in the squadron.</p>

<p>“Our numbers were not overwhelming this
time, but we know that the Huns had got pukka
wind-up by the way they disappeared when we
arrived on the line, so we felt quite confident in
taking on twice as many as ourselves. Of course
we were all out for trouble, as we wanted to show
what the new machines could do. As soon as our
leader spotted a formation of Huns, he was after
them like a flash. I think there were seven of
them, but we were all much too excited to count.
Suddenly they saw us coming, and tried desperately
to escape, but our leader got into his
favourite position, and the rear Hun hadn’t a
ghost of a chance. The next instant he was a
flaming mass.</p>

<p>“We simply had it all over the Boche for speed
and, as we had the height, they could not possibly
get away. I picked my man out as he was coming
towards me, and dived straight at him, opening
fire with both guns at close range. He suffered
the same fate as his companion.</p>

<p>“A burning machine is a glorious but terrible
sight to see&mdash;a tiny red stream of flame trickles
from the petrol tank, then long tongues of blazing
petrol lick the sides of the fuselage, and, finally,
a sheet of white fire envelops the whole machine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
and it glides steeply towards the ground in a
zigzag course, leaving a long trail of black smoke
behind it, until it eventually breaks up. There
is no doubt that your first Hun in flames gives you
a wonderful feeling of satisfaction. I can well
imagine what the big-game hunter must think
when he sees the dead lion in front of him.
Somehow, you do not realise that you are sending
a man to an awful doom, but rather your thoughts
are all turned on the hateful machine which you
are destroying, so fascinating to look at and yet so
deadly in its attack.”</p></blockquote>

<p>“Sorry I haven’t written for some time, but we
have been kept awfully busy as the weather has
been so fine. I have been trying hard to get
another Hun, and only succeeded the day before
yesterday, when we had another great scrap.</p>

<p>“Five of us met eight Huns and attacked them
the other side of the line. I missed my man in the
first dive, but turned on another and must have
hit the pilot, as he spun straight into the ground.
One of my patrol also destroyed an Albatros by
shooting him up so that he fell to bits in the air.
The remaining six Huns put up quite a good fight,
and nearly got one of us by doing in his lateral
control. However, he managed to land all right,
as these machines are fairly stable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
“On scanning my kite, I discovered that it had
not escaped scot-free, as a large piece of the tail
plane had been shot away.</p>

<p>“There was tremendous excitement in the
squadron yesterday, as our ‘stunt <span class="locked">merchant’<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a></span>
has been awarded the V.C. for that aerodrome
show that I told you about. We celebrated it
last night by one of the finest ‘busts’ I have ever
had. There were speeches and lots of good
‘bubbly,’ consequently everyone was in the best
of spirits.</p>

<p>“After dinner we had a torchlight procession
to the various squadrons stationed on the aerodrome.
This was led by our Very light experts.
Luckily for us, the night was very dull and cloudy,
or else I expect old man Boche would have had a
hand in it too. We charged into one mess and
proceeded to throw everyone and everything we
came across out of the window. We then went
over to the other squadron. The wretched lads
were all in bed, but we soon had them out, and
bombarded their mess with Very lights, the great
stunt being to shoot one in through one window
and out at the other. I can’t imagine why the
blessed place didn’t go up in flames. After
annoying these people for a bit, we retired to our
own mess, where we danced and sang till the
early hours of the morning. I have still got
a piece of plaid cloth about 6 inches square,
which was the only thing left of a perfectly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
good pair of ‘trouse’ that belonged to one of
our Scotch compatriots.</p>

<p>“This morning the C.O. sent for me to go to
the orderly room. He told me that my name had
come through for <span class="locked">H.E.,<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a></span> and congratulated me
on having been awarded the M.C.</p>

<p>“Later I went round to the sheds to say goodbye
to the men, and finally ended up at the mess
to have a farewell drink with all my old friends.</p>

<p>“I can hardly realise that the time has come
for me to go back to Blighty. I shall be awfully
bucked to see you again in a few days, old chap,
and yet I can’t help feeling sad at leaving this
dear old place&mdash;full of memories, sometimes tragic,
sometimes comic. It is very hard to part with
these comrades of mine&mdash;‘Knights of the Air,’
who live from day to day facing eternity with a
smile, and laying down their lives, if need be, with
such heroism, for the cause of freedom.”</p></blockquote>

<p>To return to the squadron which we left at
Marie Capelle. On March 8, 1918, orders arrived
to move up to Bailleul&mdash;a good deal nearer the line&mdash;where
they remained for over a fortnight. This
aerodrome was shelled every day that they were
there, and on the last two nights was heavily
bombed. On March 27 they were rushed down to
Bellevue, near Doullens, to cope with the offensive
which, as few will have forgotten, began on the
21st. This move brought the squadron back into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
the 13th Wing, in which it served, except for the
winter of 1917&ndash;18, during the whole of its career
on the Western Front. After three days at Bellevue
another move was ordered to Fienvilliers.</p>

<p>On March 30, in the course of one patrol,
Hammersley, the leader, destroyed two Hun
scouts, putting one on to the roof of a house in
Hem, where it burst into flames; while Copeland,
Hegarty, Duncan, and Griffiths all shot down
hostile machines, the destruction of which was
officially confirmed. Bartlett also shot down one
out of control. Both Copeland and Duncan were
now piling up good scores.</p>

<p>On April 12 there was yet another move, this
time to Boffles, where they stayed until September.
For some time past they had been in tents,
ready to move at a moment’s notice, and by now
all the household goods which a squadron accumulated
during the period of stationary warfare
had disappeared: the bronze figures and silver
basins, brought back as mementoes (on payment)
after celebrations in Amiens and elsewhere; the
original of Fleming Williams’ picture of a Nieuport
scout; the cut-glass reproductions of two of his
father’s valuable decanters, presented to the
squadron by Lord Dalmeny on his departure for
Egypt with General Allenby; the German signboards,
shell-cases, and other trophies; all had
been left behind or were lost long before the March
retreat and the subsequent victorious advance were
over. This was a pity, but could not be helped.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
The losses of the Air Force during this retreat
were very heavy indeed. Usually we used to
calculate that the Germans lost twice as many
machines as the British, according to the reports
issued by our Headquarters. This thought was
a comforting one. Under the head of hostile
machines destroyed are not included, for the
purpose of this calculation, those shown as driven
down out of control. It should be remembered
that Headquarters required very clear confirmation
before officially recognising the destruction of an
enemy machine, and that many Huns must have
been destroyed which were not counted. If one
set fire to a Boche machine in the air there was no
difficulty, as the whole sky saw it and confirmation
was readily forthcoming; but where this was not
done, it was not at all easy to watch the victim
glide down from fifteen or sixteen thousand feet,
and to mark the spot at which he crashed. It
takes a long time to reach the ground from nearly
three miles up, and there were always plenty of
watchful enemies in the sky waiting to swoop on
to the overkeen pilot who forgot everything but
his presumably vanquished foe. Once a pilot
took his eyes off a machine, it was by no means
always easy to pick it up again. The best type
was always careful not to claim a doubtful Hun,
and, though there were plenty who would like to
have done so, the other officers of the flight
generally knew pretty well when a doubtful claim
was put in, and soon gave the offender a hint that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
such conduct did the squadron no good. It may,
therefore, fairly be assumed that we had destroyed
the full number of machines claimed. The German
method of calculation was somewhat different, as
they counted a two-seater machine as two
“victories,” which made their star pilots appear
to be more successful than ours.</p>

<p>Throughout the war, on the Western Front, the
policy of the R.F.C., as directed by General Sir
Hugh Trenchard, was that our fighters should
engage the enemy over his territory and never
allow him to cross our lines. These orders were
never executed with complete success, as it is not
possible to erect and maintain an aerial barrage,
so to speak, which can completely prevent a
resolute pilot from penetrating it if he really means
to do so, nor can it be said that our patrols kept,
in every case, always on the other side of the line.
Broadly speaking, however, we fought over alien
territory, the Germans over their own. The
effect of this was that many a British machine was
forced to land, disabled by gunfire or through
engine failure, and the occupants, even though
unwounded, were lost to their own side till the
end of the war. The German pilot, on the other
hand, whose engine was put out of action in a
fight might land safely, get another machine, and
be fighting again the same day.</p>

<p>Another circumstance which, in fairness to the
Air Force, should always be borne in mind when
the conditions of fighting in the air are under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
discussion, is that on the Western Front the wind
entered very much into all questions of aerial
strategy or tactics. The prevailing wind was
that west wind which Conrad thus describes in a
brilliant passage, and which, though it deals with
the sea, is equally true of the air on the Western
Front:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The narrow seas around these isles, where
British admirals keep watch and ward upon the
marches of the Atlantic Ocean, are subject to the
turbulent sway of the west wind.</p>

<p>“Call it north-west or south-west, it is all one&mdash;a
different phase of the same character, a changed
expression of the same face. In the orientation
of the winds that rule the seas, the north and
south directions are of no importance. The north
and the south winds are but small princes in the
dynasties that make peace and war upon the sea.
In the polity of the winds, as among the tribes of
the earth, the real struggle lies between east and
west. The end of the day is the time to gaze at
the kingly face of the westerly weather, who is the
arbiter of ships’ destinies.</p>

<p>“Benignant and splendid, or splendid and
sinister, the western sky reflects the hidden
purpose of the royal wind.</p>

<p>“Clothed in a mantle of dazzling gold or draped
in rags of black cloud like a beggar, the might of
the westerly wind sits enthroned upon the western
horizon, with the whole North Atlantic as a foot-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>stool
for his feet and the first twinkling stars
making a diadem for his brow.”</p></blockquote>

<p>It was this powerful sovereign, this pitiless
potentate who, five days out of seven, fought with
our enemies against us, and it is to be hoped that
he is properly humiliated by the result of the war.
How many curses have been levelled at his careless
head by pilots who, with trailing wires, with
labouring, failing engines, and with tattered planes
have tried, and often tried in vain, to reach that
brown, smoky strip of battered terrain which
marked the lines and safety, after a bitter fight?
How often has a patrol, on a day with the wind at
fifty to sixty miles an hour, at 10,000 feet fought
batch after batch of Huns when on the Mons-Maubeuge
or some other “long reconnaissance,”
only to find that, though every enemy may have
been shot down in flames, though no black-crossed
machines remained to smirch the sky, inexorable
Zephyrus had swept them during the fight so far
towards the Rhine that lack of petrol must force
them to land on hostile ground? Who has not
felt, when turning homewards on a stormy day,
that the machine could make no progress at all
against the wind, but seemed for minutes that
were like hours to stand still over some town or
village? Actually headway was as a rule being
made, but the change in ground speed from flying
down-wind to struggling against it produced this
very powerful illusion, and pilots have often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
thrown their guns, ammunition, and even field-glasses
overboard with the frantic hope of
lightening the machine and thus increasing her
speed.</p>

<p>No! Zephyrus, who should have been a Teuton
god, and who beyond question wears the Iron
Cross, was no friend to the Air Force. We
should perhaps have poured out libations to
his eastern brothers&mdash;Eurus and Aquilus&mdash;or
at very least have recommended them for the
immediate award of the Distinguished Flying
Cross in recognition of their invaluable services
throughout the war.</p>

<p>The struggle wore on through May, and during
the middle of this month the fighting in the air
was terrific.</p>

<p>One hundred and thirty E.A. (enemy aircraft)
were brought down by the Air Force in France
between the 13th and 19th of the month. Belgrave
and Scholte were, perhaps, the most
successful, but I. M. Davies, A. W. Saunders,
Hegarty, V. S. Griffith, W. A. Duncan, were
also very prominent. During one patrol, led
by Belgrave on June 12, in which he shot down
a two-seater, R. G. Lewis, whose engine presumably
had failed, went down and landed,
breaking his under-carriage. H. A. Gordon, a
Canadian whose first trip over the lines this was,
landed beside him and got out of his own machine.
At this point some soldiers appeared and opened
fire. Gordon ran back to his S.E., calling to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
Lewis to get in with him, but the latter, apparently
mistaking the troops for friends, walked towards
them. Gordon then took off and circled round,
meaning to fire, but, seeing Lewis in the midst of
them, refrained, and returned home with his
machine very badly shot about. He was killed
two months later.</p>

<p>An S.E.5 has carried two before now, but it is
an unpleasant experience for the passenger, who
has to sit with his legs on each side of the pilot’s
shoulders and to hold on to the top gun-mounting.</p>

<p>By this time, Bishop was back in France
commanding No. 85 Squadron and was doing
wonders. Much of his success was due now, as
always, to his extremely accurate shooting, the
importance of which in aerial fighting it is almost
impossible to exaggerate.</p>

<p>W. H. Saunders did a very good show on July 2,
fighting continuously for forty-five minutes, destroying
two Pfalz scouts and engaging five other
hostile machines.</p>

<p>At the beginning of July, Barry Moore was
promoted to command No. 1 Aeroplane Supply
Depot at Marquise, and J. B. McCudden, V.C.,
D.S.O., M.C., was appointed to succeed him in the
command of the squadron. While flying down to
take over from Moore, he got his machine into a
spin near the ground, crashed, and was killed.
Though he never actually joined 60, and though
this history is concerned only to describe the
exploits of that squadron, a paragraph must,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
nevertheless, be devoted to McCudden’s achievements.
He joined the R.F.C. as an air mechanic
before the war, fought as an N.C.O. pilot with
29 Squadron during 1916&ndash;17, was then given a
commission and was posted to 56 Squadron, where
he specialised in two-seaters, that variety of two-seater
which the Germans would send over very
high at 20,000 feet or more on clear days to
photograph our back areas, and which were not
easy to bring down. The difficulty was that they
were first seen, as a rule, at a great height, and our
fighting machines had to climb up to them, which
would take fifteen minutes at least. During
this interval which necessarily elapsed before the
attacking machines could get their height, the
Rumpler or L.V.G., which would be flying level,
could usually outdistance the pursuers; if, however,
the British machine contrived, by flying the
inside of the circle, to keep between the Hun and
the lines, the latter, if he was as cunning as they
usually were, would calmly continue his photography
while his adversary was climbing until
the latter was about 1,500 feet below him, and,
when his pursuer was getting close enough to
be dangerous, would put his nose down slightly,
open up his engine and disappear into Hunland,
leaving a streak of blue smoke, but nothing more
tangible, behind him.</p>

<p>McCudden, however, with great resolution and
infinite patience, studied the habits of these folk
and shot down dozens of them. In addition, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
was a brilliant and successful patrol leader and
one whom the Air Force could ill spare. After his
death, C. M. Crowe, M.C., who also had a fine
record both in 56 Squadron and, earlier in the war,
with other units, was given the command. After
a few weeks, Crowe had a serious motor accident
and was “struck off” the strength, to be posted
later to 85 Squadron. He was succeeded by A.
C. Clarke, an old Etonian, who remained in charge
till the end of the war.</p>

<p>On August 1, 60, together with 3, 56, and 11
Squadrons, carried out an extremely successful
raid on Epinoy Aerodrome. Sixteen machines
were believed to have been destroyed as a result
of this operation and two large fires were started,
the smoke of which ascended to a height of over
10,000 feet. 60 and 11 did the “upper guard,”
escorting 3 and 56, who went down and actually
shot up the aerodrome, whilst the two former
squadrons kept off hostile machines who might
have attacked the raiders from above.</p>

<p>Raids of this kind were most successful, but
had only lately become possible on account of the
much larger number of squadrons which were now
available. Up to this time, the number of
machines had been only just sufficient to get
through the ordinary routine work, i.e. low flying
on battle days, offensive patrols for the indirect
protection of the artillery machine, by the destruction
of the enemy scouts who would have
interfered with them, and escorts to bombing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
raids and photographic reconnaissances. These
last two duties the improved types of two-seater
fighters now carried out without escorts&mdash;the De
Havilland 4s, 9s, and Bristol fighters being quite
capable of operating without protection by scouts.</p>

<p>During August, R. K. Whitney (who had had a
great month in July), Doyle, G. M. Duncan,
Buckley, and A. W. Saunders (who was now a
flight commander), were all fighting well. One
patrol led by the last-named on August 9 accounted
for four enemy aircraft.</p>

<p>Lieut. A. Beck now rejoined the squadron:
he had been with us in June 1917, but was sent
home on the representation of his parents, who
complained that he was only seventeen. Returning
a year later, he speedily showed that his youth
was no disqualification. He remained with the
squadron till the end, was promoted flight commander,
and did extraordinarily good work.</p>

<p>On August 8 we assumed the offensive east of
Amiens. 60 did a great deal of low flying and low
bombing, as well as the usual “scrapping” up
above. The Fokker biplane D.7 first appeared
in numbers at this time. This was an original
type of machine without any external wiring but
with a very thick wing section, which was braced
internally. Its performance was very good, alike
as regards speed, climb, and power to manœuvre.
Their pilots were usually provided with parachutes,
which quite often failed to open. From all along
the line reports now came in showing that the use<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
of the parachute was becoming fairly general
among German pilots.</p>

<p>In October, while our advance was proceeding,
squadrons of the Air Force dropped some thousands
of boxes of rations and ammunition for Belgian
troops, whose supplies had been held up owing to
the speed of the advance. 60, however, took no
part in this.</p>

<p>The map opposite is reproduced by permission
of Field-Marshal Earl Haig, and is published, I
believe, for the first time. It shows the situation
on September 25, 1918, and makes it clear that
the enemy feared the Amiens sector more than
any other part of their line.</p>

<p>H. C. M. Orpen, I. W. Rayner, S. V. Mason, M.
D. Sinclair, O. P. Johnson, G. M. Duncan, and
McEntegart were, perhaps, the most prominent
and successful pilots during the British advance,
which was a time of continuous and sustained
effort on the part of every officer, N.C.O., and man
in the whole squadron. The strain of sending at
least two full-strength squadron patrols daily over
the line, while moving continually, severely taxed
the endurance of all ranks. They left Boffles for
Baisieux on September 17, Baisieux for Beugnatre
on October 14, and finally moved from the
latter station to Quievy, an old German aerodrome,
on October 31.</p>

  <p class="smaller notbold"><i>On this date, the 25<sup>th</sup> Sept., General Pershing
    was in direct command of the American Armies.
    Early in October the command of the 3<sup>rd</sup> American
    Army was entrusted to L<sup>t</sup> Gen. Hunter Liggett
    and command of the 2<sup>nd</sup> American Army to
    Major Gen. R. L. Bullard.</i></p></div></div>

<p>By October the Air Force mechanical transport
had begun to wear out, nor is this surprising when
the work it had done is remembered; the men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
were always working hard to keep the lorries and
light tenders on the road. Moreover, the new
aerodromes were always pitted with shell-holes,
which had to be filled up, and scarcely was
this task completed before orders would arrive to
move again. In spite of these difficulties, the
supplies of rations, ammunition, etc., were maintained
with wonderful regularity by the H.Q.
staffs.</p>

<p>The German Flying Corps continued to fight
hard and well up to the very last day of the war,
and, though their armies on the ground were
retreating fast, no signs of demoralisation in the
air were observed.</p>

<p>During these last days, throughout September
and October, a great deal of work was done with
148&mdash;an American Camel squadron&mdash;most of
whose pilots had been trained in England. This
unit was also in the 13th Wing, and the two
squadrons moved forward together to the
various aerodromes mentioned above. They did
several good shows together, notably between
September 14 and 17, during the attack on
Havrincourt Wood, when 60 twice a day did the
“upper guard,” while 148 flew low, bombing
troops and attacking low-flying Fokkers. A considerable
amount of damage was done during the
progress of these operations. For example, on
September 26 one patrol of each squadron, working
in the same manner, gave a good exhibition of
combined work: 60’s patrol, led by Rayner, drove<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
down a flight of Fokkers into the jaws of 148, who
tackled them with such effect that three were
“crashed” and one driven down out of control.
Again, on the next day, during the Bourlon
Wood attack, 148, protected as before by 60,
crashed two enemy two-seaters, the destruction
of which was observed and confirmed by the
latter unit.</p>

<p>During the whole of the advance towards
Cambrai and beyond, the two squadrons did at
least one “show” a day together until October 30,
when the Americans left Beugnatre, near Bapaume,
to go south to join their own army near
Nancy, a very long and tiresome journey. On
the day before leaving, their last patrol with us
“crashed” either four or five Huns.</p>

<p>Their pilots were many of them trained at
London Colney, in Hertfordshire, and Lieuts.
Springs (who accounted for nine enemy machines),
L. K. Callaghan (whose score when they left for
Nancy was eight), and J. O. Creech (who had got
six Huns), were all good advertisements for the
methods adopted at that training station.</p>

<p>Other pilots conspicuous in this squadron were
two of their flight commanders (T. Clay and
F. E. Kindley) and also Lieut. C. T. McLean, all
of whom will no doubt remember a dinner in
Amiens, on October 18, in which 201 Squadron
also joined with 60 in celebrating the turn of
the tide in the Allied fortunes, a change which
148 and 17 American (this latter squadron was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
also in the 13th Wing) had certainly done their
share to bring about.</p>

<p>There was great regret on the part of all their
British comrades in arms when these two American
units went away.</p>

<p>One of the pilots of 148, who had been taken
prisoner, told a remarkable story on his return
just after the Armistice. This pilot, who had
served with 56 Squadron, also in the 13th Wing,
some months earlier, was shot down and, after
having landed more or less safely in “Hunland,”
was taken before a German intelligence officer and
asked his name and squadron. Having given his
name and rank only, his examiner said to him,
“But you were in 56&mdash;I dined with you in
December last,” and followed this up by asking
the astonished prisoner if he did not remember
a French Breguet (two-seater) landing at 56’s
aerodrome one day with an officer pilot and a
mechanic on board. The American did remember,
and recollected, too, that the pilot announced that
he was coming up from the south to join a French
squadron north of our 2nd Army near Dixmude,
but that his engine was running badly and he had
landed to make some adjustments. No one in 56
at this time knew very much about the French
Flying Corps, but everyone knew that their
machines had often passed over the intervening
British armies in this manner, particularly during
the summer of 1917, prior to the Passchendale
battles, and again in April 1918, when Foch’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
strategical schemes involved the introduction into
the middle of our 2nd Army area of a French
division, which defended Kemmel Hill after the
German break-through on the Lys. The story,
therefore, appeared to be quite a natural one, and
no one suspected for an instant that anything was
wrong. The “repairs” to the 200 h.p. Renault
engine, a type with which none of our mechanics
were very familiar, took longer than was expected,
and the “Frenchman” dined and stayed the night
with the squadron, making himself most agreeable
but refusing to drink much. Not only did he stay
one night, but, the weather next day proving
unfavourable, he remained a second, and on the
third day flew off, it is believed, to another British
aerodrome. There was no question of the truth
of the story because the hero of it showed, when
talking to his prisoner, a knowledge of the officers
in 56, their appearance and nicknames, together
with the details of the camp and aerodrome, which
could only have been obtained at first-hand.
Moreover, the American pilot remembered the
visit quite well, and even recognised his interrogator.
The German also told him that he had
played the same game with the French Flying
Corps, pretending, on a captured British machine,
to be an English pilot making his way down to our
Independent Air Force, which, under General
Trenchard, was stationed opposite Metz, a long
way from the nearest British unit.</p>

<p>It was easier for the Germans to do this kind of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
thing than it would have been for the Allies, owing
to the duality of language on our side of the line;
but, nevertheless, it must be reckoned a very fine
performance. Presumably, he left the German
aerodrome before dawn and flew about on our side
of the line until it was light enough to land, but,
even so, he was lucky not to have been attacked on
his return by German machines and anti-aircraft
guns when flying an aeroplane with Allied markings,
as it must have been impossible to warn the
German aviators that one particular Breguet was
not to be molested, mainly because of the impossibility
of distinguishing one machine from another
of the same type in the air, but also because to
circulate general instructions of this kind would
almost certainly have given the whole plan away
to some of the Allied agents who, on the whole,
were much more efficient than the German spies.</p>

<p>After the Armistice, when the question of
demobilisation began to be considered in the Air
Force and particulars of the terms of each officer’s
engagement were scrutinised, it was surprising to
find how many Americans were serving in English
scout squadrons. There seemed to be at least
three or four American citizens in each single-seater
squadron in France, out of a total in such a
squadron of twenty-five officers. Moreover, the
majority of these wore at least one medal for
gallantry, the reason being, no doubt, that these
young men were the very flower of the American
fighting stock, who felt unable to wait until their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
country came into the war, but represented themselves
to be Canadian citizens in order to join in
the contest. Had the war lasted a little longer,
most of them would, no doubt, have transferred to
their own squadrons, as some few had already
done, but at the end of 1918 their own air effort
had not yet developed sufficiently to absorb them
all.</p>

<p>To return, however, to 60. The squadron’s
last “confirmed Hun” of the war was secured on
November 1 by Capt. A. Beck, who had lately
destroyed, when flying low, a number of enemy
artillery observation machines (two-seaters).</p>

<p>The arrival at Quievy, halfway between Cambrai
and Le Cateau, where the squadron remained
until after the signing of the Armistice, was most
interesting. Here remained some of the German
semi-permanent hangars, the machine-gun emplacements
on the roofs of the houses surrounding
the aerodrome, and here, too, were people who for
four and a half long years had lived with the pilots
and observers of the German Flying Corps. The
questions asked by our officers&mdash;usually in extremely
moderate French&mdash;were endless. “How
many jobs a day did they do?” “Were their
casualties heavy?” “Were the pilots usually
officers or N.C.O.s?” “How many machines
did they have in a flight?” are only a few
examples. The answers in most cases were disappointing,
as the Boche seemed to have taken
good care to keep all civilians off his aerodromes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
The plight of the inhabitants of the occupied
territory was wretched; the retreating enemy had
driven off every single head of livestock, taking
even the poultry away over the Belgian border,
and the British forces had to feed them for many
weeks until the French lorry services began to
work and until the railways were restored.</p>

<p>Delay-action mines were left everywhere in this
part of the world, though there were not, perhaps,
as many booby traps as were found after the
Boche retreat of March 1917 to the Hindenburg
or Wotan Line. The bridge at Caudry station, the
railhead from which the squadron drew rations,
went up on November 1, killing and wounding
twenty or thirty men.</p>

<p>The uncultivated state of the land was very
noticeable in this district; for though some poor
root and winter cabbage crops showed here and
there, grown by the inhabitants under German
direction, most of the fields did not appear to have
been tilled at all, though this particular tract had
been a long way behind the line until August 1918.</p>

<p>The last few days’ fighting were marked by no
unusual incidents so far as 60 itself was concerned,
though it was thrilling to be forming part of the
army which was retaking Valenciennes, Le Quesnoy,
Maubeuge, and other towns immediately in
front of us. Thrilling, too, to see the long dingy
columns, already in Belgium, marching east at
last.</p>

<p>On Armistice night, Clarke hurriedly organised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
a dinner, to which such old members as were in
the neighbourhood were bidden. It was a good
evening, ending with the invasion of the officers’
mess by the N.C.O.s and men, who drank each
other’s healths&mdash;not that there was overmuch
alcohol available&mdash;and sang over and over again
those very ordinary music-hall songs which our
people always seem to employ as a medium for
expression in moments of emotional stress.
Officers and men bellowed together “The good
ship Yacki Hicki Doola” and similar classics.</p>

<p>60 was always remarkable for the cordial
relations between the officers and men, due,
perhaps, to the fact that an Air Force scout
squadron during the war was, in Lord Hugh
Cecil’s words, “a natural aristocracy,” in that the
officers flew and fought twice daily while the men
remained on the ground in comparative security.</p>

<span class="subhead">DEMOBILISATION</span></h2>

<p class="in0">The latter half of November and the first week
of December was a period of suspense. No one
quite knew what was to happen, nor did the first
circulars on the subject, even the famous one
beginning, “And Joshua bade the people disperse
every man to his own place,” clear up the situation
very much. It was not, in fact, until Mr. Churchill
had been appointed Secretary of State for War
and Air, and had laid down the broad principle that
men over thirty-five and those who had enlisted
before January 1, 1916, were to be allowed to go
and that the rest must stay, that we knew where
we were at all. It was difficult, also, to find
employment from day to day for the men.
Association football, however, was always popular,
concerts and boxing contests were frequently held,
while horses and dogs were borrowed and hare-hunting
was attempted.</p>

<p>One form of hare-hunting became very popular:
the idea&mdash;which originated with Louis Strange,
then commanding a wing&mdash;was to proceed as
follows: All officers and men in the wing who
wished to take part assembled, to the number of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
two or three hundred, at “the meet,” and filed
away in opposite directions, the leaders of each
file turning gradually inwards until a circle
nearly a mile in diameter was enclosed by men
about twenty yards apart. The circle being
completed, they began to walk towards the
centre. Usually three or four hares, and sometimes
many more, got up within the cordon and
ran frantically round until they either broke
through or were knocked over with sticks. The
shouting and noise arising during the proceedings
testified to the popularity of this form of sport.
Despite these diversions, time hung rather heavily
on their hands until, at last, by the end of February
1919, all the demobilisable officers and men had
gone, and those who remained were sent up by
train as reinforcements to the R.A.F. with the
Army of the Rhine. On a bitterly cold evening
this remnant entrained in covered trucks, under
sad skies with snow falling heavily, to commence
their eastward journey, in typically military
fashion, by travelling due west to Etaples. After
this nothing remained but to dispatch the cadre
with the records back to England, and the two
officers and ten men remaining accordingly departed
on February 28, bound for Sedgeford, in
Norfolk.</p>

<p>The squadron remained dormant for a time, but
was re-formed towards the end of the year, and is
now equipped with De Havilland 10s, large twin-engined
machines, and is stationed in India.</p>

THE DEFENCES OF ST. QUENTIN.</p>

<p>3. The development of these successes by a
general attack on the whole front which broke
through the last of the German defences in the rear
of the Hindenburg Line, forcing the enemy to
evacuate Cambrai and St. Quentin and fall back on
the line of the River Selle. These battles, striking
at vital enemy communications, created a huge
salient in his lines. Meanwhile further north in</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>28th Sept.&ndash;29th Sept.</i><br />
9 Divs. defeated 5
German Divs.</div>

<p><span class="sans">THE BATTLE OF YPRES</span> British and Belgians
forced the enemy back from Ypres and drove a salient
into his lines which endangered his positions on the
Belgian Coast. This success was extended by</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>14th Oct.&ndash;31st Oct.</i><br />
7 British Divs. defeated
6 German
Divs.</div>

<p><span class="sans">THE BATTLE OF COURTRAI</span> which widened
and deepened this salient and resulted in the capture
of Halluin, Menin and Courtrai. This series of
battles north and south had as their immediate
result, in the south,</p>

<p><span class="sans">THE EVACUATION OF LAON</span> and the retreat
of the enemy to the line of the Aisne, and, in the
centre,</p>

<p><span class="sans">THE WITHDRAWAL TO THE SCHELDT</span> in
which Lille and the great industrial district of
France were freed there, and in the north.</p>

<p><span class="sans">THE CLEARING OF THE BELGIAN COAST</span>,
whereby the enemy was deprived of his important
submarine bases at Ostend, Zeebrugge and Bruges.
The enemy was now back on the line of the Selle and
Scheldt rivers.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>17th Oct.&ndash;25th Oct.</i><br />
26 British Divs. defeated
31 German Divs.</div>

<p><span class="sans">THE BATTLE OF THE SELLE</span> forced him
from the line of that river and drove still another

<div class="sidenote"><i>1st Nov.&ndash;11th Nov.</i><br />
26 British Divs. defeated
32 German Divs.</div>

<p><span class="sans">THE BATTLE OF MAUBEUGE</span>, which struck
at and broke the enemy’s last important lateral
communications, turned his positions on the Scheldt
and forced him to retreat rapidly from Courtrai.
This victory completed the great strategical aim of
the whole series of battles by dividing, in effect,
the enemy’s forces into two parts, one on each side
of the great natural barrier of the Ardennes. The
pursuit of the beaten enemy all along the Allied line
was only stopped by the Armistice.</p>

Most of the officers and men are new, but such
veterans as are available will be drafted back
when circumstances allow, and there is no old
member of the squadron who is not confident that
the new formation will add to that high reputation
which 60 has enjoyed from the day of its birth, and
which we, who served in it, have helped to build,
or, at all events, have tried our hardest not to
damage.</p>

<p>Though the records, owing to a fire in the
squadron office in November 1916, may perhaps
be not quite complete, yet the destruction of 274
enemy aircraft can be traced.</p>

<p>The honours gained by officers or men, whilst
serving in the squadron, are:</p>

<ul>
<li class="figspace">1 V.C.<br /></li>
<li class="figspace">5 D.S.O.s.<br /></li>
<li class="figspace">1 Bar to D.S.O.<br /></li>
<li>37 Military Crosses.<br /></li>
<li class="figspace">5 Distinguished Flying Crosses.</li>
</ul>

<p>The map which will be found at the end of this
chapter is published by permission of Field-Marshal
Earl Haig, and shows very clearly the
ground gained and the prisoners taken by the
victorious British armies during the last three
months of the war.</p>

<span class="subhead">BATTLE CASUALTIES</span></h2>

<p class="in0">In this list each officer is given in the rank which he held
at the time he was wounded or missing. It is very
apparent that it was during April 1917 that the squadron
went through the bitterest fighting. There were 20
casualties in this month alone. The worst month after
this was September 1917, with 8 casualties, while in July
and again in September 1918, 6 pilots “went west.”</p>

<p>These figures show clearly the increase in the intensity
of air fighting as the contest wore on. In August 1916,
when 60 was still a two-seater squadron with only one
scout flight, we lost 5 pilots and 2 observers; this was
thought at the time to be high, as indeed it was according
to the standard of those days, though several other
squadrons lost more heavily during the Somme. Nevertheless,
the figures show only too clearly that the Arras
fighting was far the severest trial 60 ever had, for
during April 1917 the losses were 105 per cent. The
total number of Battle Casualties is 115, sustained
during 29 months of war flying, giving an average of
just under 4 per month, or nearly one a week.</p>

<p>An analysis of the figures shows that 76 of these 115
were killed, while 39 are alive, unless, indeed, they were
killed with another squadron later in the war: but this
could only have happened to the 21 wounded who got
back to their own side of the lines.</p>

<p>Of the 72 missing, 54 are dead, 17 were repatriated
from Germany, while one, Ridley, escaped.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
Though it was true to say that roughly half of our
missing in the Air Force were alive, it will be seen that
in 60’s case the average was much smaller, only 25 per
cent. instead of 50 per cent.</p>

purposes. They did about ninety miles an hour “all
out,” and were therefore difficult to handle against the faster
Albatros. It is very often the duty of reconnaissance machines
not to engage in a fight, as their news may be lost.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_15" id="Footnote_15" href="#FNanchor_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> It is very often impossible to watch a machine after it has
been hit until it “crashes.” It is, therefore, counted as out of
control. Sometimes this was used as a “blind” by some pilots
to escape. They simply let the machine do what it liked, and
when near the ground took control again.</p></div>

the burst of fire is going. Instead of being filled with lead like
the ordinary bullet, they contain phosphorus, which commences

<p>Punctuation, hyphenation, and spelling were made consistent when a predominant
preference was found in this book; otherwise they were not changed.</p>

<p>Simple typographical errors were corrected; occasional unbalanced
quotation marks retained.</p>

<p>Ambiguous hyphens at the ends of lines were retained.</p>

<p><a href="#INDEX">Index</a> not checked for proper alphabetization or correct page references.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_xviii">xviii</a>: The five illustrations listed as being on pages 100,
112, and 118 were missing from this book.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_50">50</a>: “<i>had</i> be to” was printed that way.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_125">125</a>: For clarity, Transcriber added a colon after
“One form of hare-hunting became very popular”.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_126">126</a> (comments about map): Some “3”s and “8”s were indistinguishable.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_133">133</a>: “Lieut. E. A. Sullock, A.F.C.” may be “Sulleck”.</p>

<p><a href="#FOOTNOTES">Footnotes</a>, originally at the bottoms of pages, have been renumbered,

<p>The <a href="#INDEX">Index</a> references to footnotes have been renumbered to match
the renumbering of the eBook’s footnotes. All "return" footnote links go back to
the page on which they first appeared, not back to the Index.</p>
